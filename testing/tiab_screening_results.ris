AB  - Bedtime media use is often maligned in research and pop culture. However, the evidence for the relationship between bedtime media use and sleep for adults has been mixed – sometimes sleep quality is negatively affected by media use, sometimes it is positively affected. Competing explanations include the sleep displacement hypothesis (i.e. media use leads to later sleep onset, less total sleep, and lower sleep quality) and the media recovery hypothesis (i.e. media use helps reduce stress, and this relaxation helps people fall and stay asleep). Two retrospective diary studies test these competing hypotheses in an undergraduate sample (n = 200) and a general population U.S. adult sample (n = 202). Overall, results provide more support for the sleep displacement hypothesis than for the media recovery hypothesis. However, some evidence suggests potential for positive relationships between media use and sleep. More work is needed to explicate the complicated relationship between bedtime media use and sleep.

AB  - Given the pervasive use of screen-based media and the high prevalence of insufficient sleep among American youth and teenagers, this brief report summarizes the literature on electronic media and sleep and provides research recommendations. Recent systematic reviews of the literature reveal that the vast majority of studies find an adverse association between screen-based media consumption and sleep health, primarily via delayed bedtimes and reduced total sleep duration. The underlying mechanisms of these associations likely include the following: (1) time displacement (ie, time spent on screens replaces time spent sleeping and other activities); (2) psychological stimulation based on media content; and (3) the effects of light emitted from devices on circadian timing, sleep physiology, and alertness. Much of our current understanding of these processes, however, is limited by cross-sectional, observational, and self-reported data. Further experimental and observational research is needed to elucidate how the digital revolution is altering sleep and circadian rhythms across development (infancy to adulthood) as pathways to poor health, learning, and safety outcomes (eg, obesity, depression, risk-taking).

AB  - The link between technology and sleep is more complex than originally thought. In this updated theoretical review, we propose a new model informed by the growing body of evidence in the area over the past 10 years. The main theoretical change is the addition of bi-directional links between the use of technology and sleep problems. We begin by reviewing the evidence to date for the originally proposed mechanisms of bright light, arousal, nighttime sleep disruptions, and sleep displacement. Then, in support of the new direction of effect (sleep problems preceding technology use), we propose two new mechanisms: technology before sleep might be used as a time filler and/or as an emotional regulation strategy to facilitate the sleep-onset process. Finally, we present potential moderators of the association between technology and sleep, in recognition of protective and vulnerability factors that may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of technology on sleep and vice versa. The goal of this theoretical review is to update the field, guide future public health messages, and to prompt new research into how much technology and sleep affect each other, for whom it may be problematic, and which mechanisms may explain their association.

AB  - Social displacement is the proposition that time spent on social media replaces time spent in face-to-face interaction, particularly with close friends and family, thus reducing well-being. There is clear evidence of growing mobile and social media use, and some evidence of a decline in face-to-face communication. This essay concludes, however, there is very little direct or causal evidence of social media time displacing face-to-face time. This article concludes that increasing social media use most likely displaces other media activities. To explain findings that seem to support social displacement, this essay examines the difference between population-level trends and within-individual behavior, and the difference between within-person and between-person displacement.

TI  - More Time on Technology, Less Happiness? Associations Between Digital-Media Use and Psychological Well-Being
AU  - Twenge, Jean M.
T2  - Current Directions in Psychological Science
AB  - Studies using large samples consistently find that more frequent users of digital media are lower in psychological well-being than less frequent users; even data sets used as evidence for weak effects show that twice as many heavy users (vs. light users) are low in well-being. Differences in perspective may stem from the statistics used; I argue that comparing well-being across levels of digital-media use is more useful than the percentage of variance explained, as most studies on digital-media use do not measure other influences on well-being (e.g., genetics, trauma), and these other influences, unlike frequency of digital-media use, are rarely controllable. Nonusers are generally lower in well-being than light users of digital media, however, suggesting that limited use may be beneficial. Longitudinal and experimental studies suggest that at least some of the causation moves from digital-media use to lower well-being. Mechanisms may include the displacement of activities more beneficial to well-being (sleep, face-to-face social interaction), upward social comparison, and cyberbullying.

AB  - This study addresses continuing concern over television's displacement of other leisure activities form both substantive and methodological perspectives. It examines past conceptualizations of the mechanism by which television is assumed to displace other activities. Following a critical review of the displacement literature, the authors examine data from an 8-year panel study of the introduction of television to South Africa and use a variety of methodological approaches to illustrate a major source of inconsistency in findings from previous studies. The displacement mechanism is found to be asymmetric in nature; that is, although increases in television viewing force out some other activities, decreases in television viewing do not result in parallel increases in levels of any of these activities. This pattern of findings was most pronounced in the case of radio use and movie attendance. Implications for conceptualization of the displacement process are discussed in relation to these findings.

AB  - Television is often accused of undermining children's academic achievement. This paper investigates two explanations which frequently accompany such a claim. The displacement hypothesis predicts that the time children spend with television is taken from activities that are more beneficial to school performance. The distraction hypothesis suggests that children's cumulative exposure to the structure of television—its pace, format, etc.–engenders an intolerance for the pace of schooling. A review of research on television viewing, time displacement, and academic performance fails to find any support for the displacement hypothesis. A review of studies relevant to the distraction hypothesis, however, uncovers mixed findings. This paper presents analyses of data gathered from school children in South Africa.

TI  - It Use and Leisure Time Displacement: Convergent evidence over the last 15 years
AU  - Robinson, John P.
T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - A major concern about new technologies like information technology (IT) is how much they impact existing media and behaviour, particularly in reducing time on these behaviours. The present article first examines whether Internet users report spending less time on various leisure (and non-leisure) activities. It uses data from three separate national surveys about the public's leisure participation: (1) estimate data from the SPPA2008; (2) single-day diary data from the 2003–2007 American Time Use Survey; and (3) weekly diary data from the 2000 National Survey of Parents to examine whether users of IT participate less in various leisure activities, perhaps as a function of substituting IT use for participating more actively. First, the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) estimate data show that users and heavier IT users are also more active in a variety of other free time activities such as movies, volunteering and sports. Moreover, the relation continues to hold after education (the major predictor of leisure participation), income, age and other predictors of leisure activity are controlled. However, both daily and weekly diary data show far less if any difference, and the lack of parallel results from these diary studies raises questions about whether the SPPA correlations result from a ‘response set’ of respondents overestimating their activity participation. Nonetheless, there still seems no solid evidence that IT leads to notable decreases in social life, media use or other ways of spending both free time and non-leisure time, as claimed in the three initial surveys.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about the potential associations between social media use and mental health and wellbeing in young people. We explored associations between the frequency of social media use and later mental health and wellbeing in adolescents, and how these effects might be mediated.
METHODS: We did secondary analyses of publicly available data from the Our Futures study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of 12 866 young people from age 13 years to 16 years in England. The exposure considered was the frequency of social media use (from weekly or less to very frequent [multiple times daily]) at wave 1 (participants aged 13-14 years) through wave 3 of the study (participants aged 15-16 years). Outcomes were mental health at wave 2 (with high 12-item General Health Questionnaire [GHQ12] scores [≥3] indicating psychological distress), and wellbeing at wave 3 (life satisfaction, feeling life is worthwhile, happiness, and anxiety, rated from 1 to 10 by participants). Analyses were adjusted for a minimal sufficient confounding structure, and were done separately for boys and girls. Cyberbullying, sleep adequacy, and physical activity were assessed as potential mediators of the effects.
FINDINGS: Very frequent use of social media increased from wave 1 to wave 3: from 34·4% (95% CI 32·4-36·4) to 61·9% (60·3-63·6) in boys, and 51·4% (49·5-53·3) to 75·4% (73·8-76·9) in girls. Very frequent social media use in wave 1 predicted a high GHQ12 score at wave 2 among girls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·31 [95% CI 1·06-1·63], p=0·014; N=4429) and boys (1·67 [1·24-2·26], p=0·0009; N=4379). Persistent very frequent social media use across waves 1 and 2 predicted lower wellbeing among girls only (adjusted ORs 0·86 [0·74-0·99], N=3753, p=0·039 for life satisfaction; 0·80 [0·70-0·92], N=3831, p=0·0013 for happiness; 1·28 [1·11-1·48], N=3745, p=0·0007 for anxiety). Adjustment for cyberbullying, sleep, and physical activity attenuated the associations of social media use with GHQ12 high score (proportion mediated 58·2%), life satisfaction (80·1%), happiness (47·7%), and anxiety (32·4%) in girls, such that these associations (except for anxiety) were no longer significant; however, the association with GHQ12 high score among boys remained significant, being mediated only 12·1% by these factors.
INTERPRETATION: Mental health harms related to very frequent social media use in girls might be due to a combination of exposure to cyberbullying or displacement of sleep or physical activity, whereas other mechanisms appear to be operative in boys. Interventions to promote mental health should include efforts to prevent or increase resilience to cyberbullying and ensure adequate sleep and physical activity in young people.

AU  - Wu-Ouyang, Biying
T2  - Journal of Media Psychology
AB  - Abstract: The rise of mobile technology and social media has created a fragmented and interconnected social media landscape. Drawing from the concept of polymedia and media repertoire, this study paints social media as an integrated environment and introduces the concept of multiplatform mobile connectedness (MMC) as a representation of an individual’s curative social media repertoire, shaped by meanings attributed to each mobile media platform. By examining its relationship with negative well-being, this study contributes to the debate on the displacement or reinforcement hypothesis of mobile media in an integrated environment. Focusing on emerging adulthoods in China, this study reveals that MMC is associated with higher negative well-being through fear of missing out (FoMO) and leisure boredom. This finding offers a new perspective from MMC on the impact of mobile media on well-being.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Background
              Connectedness to family and peers is a key determinant of adolescent mental health. Existing research examining associations between social media use and social connectedness has been largely quantitative and has focused primarily on loneliness, or on specific aspects of peer relationships. In this qualitative study we use the displacement hypothesis and the stimulation hypothesis as competing theoretical lenses through which we examine the complex relationship between social media use and feelings of connectedness to family and peers.
            
            
              Methods
              In-depth paired and individual interviews were conducted with twenty-four 13–14-year-olds in two inner-city English secondary schools. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed.
            
            
              Results
              Analysis identified four themes: (i) ‘Displacement of face-to-face socialising’ (ii) ‘Social obligations’ (iii) ‘(Mis)Trust’ and (iv) ‘Personal and group identity’. Results indicated stronger support for the stimulation hypothesis than the displacement hypothesis. We found evidence of a complex set of reciprocal and circular relationships between social media use and connectedness consistent with a ‘rich-get-richer’ and a ‘poor-get-poorer’ effect for family and peer connectedness – and a ‘poor-get-richer’ effect in peer connectedness for those who find face-to-face interactions difficult.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our findings suggest that parents should take a measured approach to social media use, providing clear guidance, promoting trust and responsible time management, and acknowledging the role of social media in making connections. Understanding and sharing in online experiences is likely to promote social connectedness. Supporting young people to negotiate breathing space in online interactions and prioritising trust over availability in peer relationships may optimise the role of social media in promoting peer connectedness.

AB  - Comparing the daily time use of three consecutive cohorts of Swedish young adults 20–29 years old, we analyse changes in free-time activity patterns over a period when private Information and Communications Technology (ICT) use was introduced, expanded, and went online. We use Swedish Time Use Survey (TUS) data from 1990/1991, 2000/2001 and 2010/2011 and apply covariate analysis, controlling for important socio-economic factors. Our theoretical approach complements a regular displacement/enhancement perspective by emphasizing the role of time elasticities, time-use priorities, and free-time availability (i.e. being time-poor vs time-rich). Results indicate that online time increased considerably, adapting to increased free time. In addition, offline time spent on social activities, activities with other people, reading books and newspapers and offline hobbies consistently declined. TV viewing increased among the time-rich, fuelling overall screen time. Time spent on outdoor physical activity, entertainment, culture, and voluntary work appear unaffected.

T2  - Human Communication Research
AB  - Seminal studies concerning the Internet brought legitimacy to public concerns about its dissocializing effects. Although the negative social and professional outcomes of the Internet are still attributed to the time users spend online, scholars have more recently turned their attention to media habits in explaining these effects. This investigation tests the displacement and media habit perspectives on the consequences of Internet use. Study 1 uses cross-sectional data to test the displacement and Internet habit positions. The data support media habit theory explanations but find little support for displacement theory. Study 2 replicates the results of Study 1 with longitudinal data from incoming college freshmen. Study 3 holds time constant and examines the causal direction between functional difficulties and habit strength. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - We explore from a time-use perspective how private use of computers and the Internet [information and communications technologies (ICTs)] is transforming everyday life. Data from the Swedish 2010-2011 Time-Use Survey reflect a situation in which Internet use has spread widely and become routine for many. Using covariate analysis, we analyse differences in general time use between four groups of ICT users ranging from non-users to heavy users. The theoretical departure point is a nuanced discussion of the time-displacement concept. Results indicate that private time spent using ICTs is associated primarily with individuals' available free time, that is, elastic relative to time for paid work (i.e. contracted time). Heavy ICT users spend more time on activities carried out alone, are more home centred, and less mobile. Heavy use is associated with somewhat less committed time spent, for example, on maintenance work or taking care of children. Regarding personal time, time for meals is negatively related to heavy use, while night-time sleep is unaffected. Concerning free time, heavy use takes time from sports and outdoor recreation, but has no effect on offline media use, entertainment and cultural activities, or reading. Heavy use does not affect time spent on social activities, for example, for social interaction with family and friends or time spent on voluntary associations. Observed differences become significant at certain thresholds of ICT-related time use, involving heavy users who spend one hour or more on computers and the Internet every day.

AB  - In nationally representative samples of U.S. adolescents (age: 13–18) and entering college students, 1976–2017 ( N = 8.2 million), iGen adolescents in the 2010s (vs. previous generations) spent less time on in-person (face-to-face) social interaction with peers, including getting together or socializing with friends, going to parties, going out, dating, going to movies, and riding in cars for fun. College-bound high school seniors in 2016 (vs. the late 1980s) spent an hour less a day engaging in in-person social interaction, despite declines in paid work and little change in homework or extracurricular activity time. The results suggest that time displacement occurs at the cohort level, with in-person social interaction declining as digital media use increased, but not at the individual level, where in-person social interaction and social media use are positively correlated. Adolescents’ feelings of loneliness increased sharply after 2011. Adolescents low in in-person social interaction and high in social media use reported the most loneliness.

AB  - ABSTRACT
            
              The increasing popularity of Facebook among adolescents has stimulated research to investigate the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness, which is particularly prevalent in adolescence. The aim of the present study was to improve our understanding of the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Specifically, we examined how Facebook motives and two relationship‐specific forms of adolescent loneliness are associated longitudinally. Cross‐lagged analysis based on data from 256 adolescents (64% girls,
              M
              age
              = 15.88 years) revealed that peer‐related loneliness was related over time to using Facebook for social skills compensation, reducing feelings of loneliness, and having interpersonal contact. Facebook use for making new friends reduced peer‐related loneliness over time, whereas Facebook use for social skills compensation increased peer‐related loneliness over time. Hence, depending on adolescents' Facebook motives, either the displacement or the stimulation hypothesis is supported. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Television is one of the most commonly viewed forms of media by children throughout the world. Excessive television viewing can influence the quality of children's relationships and interactions with their parents. We examined the emotional availability (
              EA
              ) of children toward their parents by assessing
              child responsiveness
              and
              child involvement
              , using a cross‐sectional and longitudinal design. We employed a large and representative community sample of Norwegian 4‐year‐olds (
              n
              = 995) who were followed up at 6 years old (
              n
              = 795). The results illustrate that, when viewing excessive amounts of television, children are less likely to be involved with their parents in ordinary toy‐play. We argue in favor of the displacement hypothesis, stating that time‐demanding technologies are negatively related to the quality of parent–child relationships because spending more time watching television will leave less time for developing nurturing social relationships.

TI  - Information Technology Use and Cyberbullying Behavior in South Thailand: A Test of the Goldilocks Hypothesis
AU  - Sittichai, Ruthaychonnee
AU  - Smith, Peter K.
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
AB  - There has been concern about the effects of high levels of internet use on the mental well-being of young people. This has generally been phrased in terms of a displacement hypothesis, that the extent of internet use and mental well-being are directly proportional. This linear model has been contrasted with a Goldilocks Hypothesis, proposed by Przybylski and Weinstein. This supposes that moderate levels of internet use may be the least harmful, conforming to a curvilinear relationship. Here these hypotheses were tested on a sample of 1140 adolescents (42% boys, 58% girls) aged 12–18 years, in 12 schools from Southern Thailand. We first report levels of internet use, and of cybervictimization, taken as one important aspect of mental well-being. We then assess the relationship of four factors of internet use (frequency, time spent, number of places accessed, number of activities) with (a) being a victim of cyberbullying, and (b) being a frequent victim; taking these as indicators of mental well-being. For (a) there was limited evidence of a Goldilocks effect on two out of four measures. For (b) the evidence did support a Goldilocks effect for all four measures, but these were under-powered analyses and the findings did not reach statistical significance. If substantiated on larger samples, a curvilinear relationship between aspects of internet use and cyberbullying would suggest a ‘safe zone’ for adolescent internet use, bringing its benefits while minimizing risks of cyberbullying. In the future, similar research should use larger sample sizes or longitudinal measures when exploring nonlinear trends and include other aspects of mental well-being.

              Objective
              Previous research linked problematic mobile social media use to non‐suicidal self‐injury (NSSI). However, little research explored the underlying mechanism. Drawing on the social displacement hypothesis, which suggests that excessive social media use may disrupt offline social interactions, leading to negative emotional experiences, the study employs a longitudinal design to explore the relationship between problematic mobile social media use and NSSI, with a specific emphasis on the mediating role of self‐disgust.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 1,684 Chinese adolescents (52.3% females;
                M

                  age
                
                 = 1.27) completed self‐report questionnaires regarding problematic mobile social media use, self‐disgust, and NSSI. The assessment was conducted in three waves, 6 months apart.
              
            
            
              Results
              Using latent growth curve and structural equation modeling, our study observed a consistent linear decline in NSSI levels over time. Higher initial NSSI levels correlated with a slower reduction. Problematic mobile social media use positively influenced the initial level of NSSI. Additionally, self‐disgust played a mediating role in the relationship between problematic mobile social media use and NSSI.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The study underscores the importance of understanding the emotional experiences behind social media use, beyond mere usage duration. By revealing the mediating role of self‐disgust, it provides new insights into the complex interplay between problematic mobile social media use and adolescent NSSI.

AB  - Smartphones are omnipresent and serve as a tool for various purposes. In Switzerland, more than 90% of the population owns a smartphone and uses it on average around 2.0 to 5 h daily. Smartphone app use is linked with both higher and lower levels of well-being. However, it remains unclear whether smartphone app use is the antecedent or the consequence of well-being. Based on the stimulation (online communication increases well-being) and the displacement (online communication decreases well-being) hypotheses, this study explores how daily smartphone app use and well-being are associated over time. A total of N = 130 employees (M = 35.61; SD = 10.62) participated in a three-week intensive longitudinal study. Daily minutes of different types of smartphone app use (e.g. email apps and chat apps) were tracked by a mobile application. Furthermore, daily self-reports of positive and negative affect were assessed in a morning and end-of day diary. Positive morning affect was negatively associated with the use of email apps. Furthermore, a negative between-person relationship of chat app use with end-of day positive affect was observed. The results are in favour of the displacement hypothesis. Future studies should investigate causal relationships between specific forms of smartphone usage and the user's well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since the beginning of the digital age, there have been critical voices claiming that spending time with digital media might reduce time dedicated to school-related obligations, leading to detrimental effects on academic performance. However, findings on this topic are mixed and lack large-scale time-use data that allow the investigation of displacement effects from a long-term perspective. To address this research gap, we tested a Time-allocation Model of Media Use among 12- to 18-year-old students from three different media generations (Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z). The analysis relies on high-quality daily diary data (i.e., all existing data sets of the German Time-Use Survey) collected between 1991 and 2013 (N1991/1992 = 1,310, N2001/2002 = 1,329, N2012/2013 = 1,274). The findings of the partial least squares structural equation modeling multigroup analysis demonstrate that free time availability is an important predictor of media choice. Moreover, although digital media use considerably increased over time, the effects on school-related obligation time remained largely stable and, most importantly, small. The study offers new insights into changes in media use and their effects on school-related obligation time across different generations from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. It is adaptable for future research, analyzing prospective media generations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)Impact StatementThis study provides new insights into the potential impact of digital media use on academic performance among adolescents from different generations. Despite concerns that digital media activities (e.g., digital gaming, chatting) may displace school-related obligations, the study found that its effects remained small and stable over a 20-year time span. However, the influence of social media use is still uncertain, and more research needs to be done on prospective media generations with more recent data.

AB  - Background: Young children's digital media use may adversely affect child development, but the mechanisms of this association are unclear. We evaluated whether screen time displaces reading and peer play time, which are subsequently associated with child development. Method(s): When children were 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months, mothers (n = 3894) reported the time their children spent on screens, being read to by an adult, and playing with other children. At 36 months, mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire©, an assessment of their child's developmental status. Result(s): In unadjusted models, screen time from 12 to 36 months was not associated with reading but was associated with less time engaging in play with peers. In adjusted models accounting for developmental delay at 12 months, family and child characteristics, screen time was not directly associated with developmental delay. More peer play time was associated with a lower likelihood of developmental delay, and having higher screen time increased the likelihood of developmental delay indirectly through reduced peer play time. Results were similar for developmental delays in fine and gross motor, communication, and personal-social domains. Conclusion(s): Screen time in early childhood did not displace reported time spent reading, but did displace reported peer play time. Impact: Among children 1-3 years of age, more screen time was associated with less time engaged in peer play but not less reading with an adult.Having higher screen time from 1 to 3 years increased the odds of developmental delay indirectly through reduced peer play time.Ensuring that children engage in adequate time playing with peers may offset the negative associations between screen time and child development.Copyright © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

We investigated whether risk‐taking perceptions influenced length of adolescent technology use at bedtime and whether being aware of time moderated this association.
            
            
              Methods
              We recruited 16 males and five females, with a mean age of 17.6 years, from school and university populations to assess adolescent technology use and bedtimes. They were assessed for trait risk‐taking using the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events questionnaire and had unrestrained access to a video game on two separate nights, counterbalanced for clock present or clock absent conditions. The adolescents’ self‐selected bedtime provided a measure of the level of technology use and was the dependent variable.
            
            
              Results
              Adolescents who perceived fewer negative consequences of risky activities on the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events played the video game longer and went to bed later than those who perceived more negative consequences (p = 0.03). There was no influence on bedtimes from perceived benefits of risk‐taking or clock presence.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Adolescents who perceived fewer negative consequences of risk‐taking were more likely to stay up later using technology, facing a heightened risk of displaced sleep.

AB  - The amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as smartphones has led to concerns that computer-mediated communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents' relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents' renegotiation of closeness and autonomy with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents' relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents' adjustment of autonomy-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

AB  - This study examines the negative effects of social media addiction on the reading habits of second language learners at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. It is anchored on two theories: the Uses and Gratification theory and the Time Displacement theory. These theories were exploited in assessing the effects of addiction to the use of social media on the reading habits of second-language users. The quantitative method for data collection and analysis was adopted. A questionnaire was administered to 525 respondents to ascertain the level of their addiction to social media and reading habits. The study shows that students are seriously addicted to social media, spending 3-4 hours on non-academic matters, which affects their reading habits seriously. Based on the above discoveries, it is recommended that compulsory orientations should be organised on when, how, and what social media should be used for.

T2  - Frontiers in Psychiatry
AB  - Background
              To date, the relationship between diverse time use behaviors and depression status among emerging adults have not been disentangled in the literature. Therefore, if and how the time displacement mechanism activates depressive symptoms among emerging adults remains unclear.
            
            
              Methods
              
                To fill this gap in the literature, we employed a network analysis to make estimations. The emerging adult sample (
                N
                = 1,811) was collected by the Guizhou Population Health Cohort Study. Time use behaviors were measured by an adaption of the self-administered International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
              
            
            
              Results
              The results revealed that the time displacement mechanism of emerging adults differed from that of adolescents. Sleep duration was not crowded out by other activities, while the time spent on computer use was found to be negatively related to time spent on heavy work activities. Moreover, computer use behavior triggered three depressive symptoms (“Anhedonia,” “Guilt,” and “Motor”), but inhibited “Suicide.” The results of the directed acyclic graph revealed that females and heavy drinkers were at risk of depression.
            
            
              Limitations
              The study sample was confined to only one province, which may limit its generalizability. The cross-sectional design impeded the ability to draw causal inferences.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our results enhance the current understanding of the internal mechanism of how time use behaviors influence depressive symptoms among emerging adults.

AB  - Abstract
            
              Background:
              This paper determines longitudinal changes in the time Spanish adolescents devote to moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen media activity (SMA). Moreover, it examines the displacement hypothesis between time spent on SMA and MVPA.
            
            
              Methods:
              A cohort of 755 adolescents participated in a prospective cohort study over a three‐year period. Repeated measures ANOVA to highlight interaction effects among all variables and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were employed.
            
            
              Results:
              Age and gender‐related variations in longitudinal changes in time spent on MVPA and SMA evolved in the inverse direction (decreased on MVPA/increased on SMA) according to the ANOVA. The potential displacement between time spent on SMA and MVPA from Wave I to Wave II was analysed via SEM. The first model, estimated in the overall sample, showed no evidence for the displacement hypothesis. Subsequently, a multigroup sequence of panel models was performed and a partial displacement was observed only in boys. Hence, boys who spent more time on SMA were more likely to devote less time to MVPA three years later.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              This study confirms the opposite trend on the time spent on MVPA and SMA over a three‐year period, being clearly higher in SMA. Further SEM analyses reveal a deferred displacement hypothesis between SMA and MVPA only in boys. This partial gendered displacement may be linked to the different uses adolescents make of screen media. The incursion of new technological devices (smartphones or tablets) and their wide range of possibilities for social networking or gaming could explain this displacement

AB  - Masspersonal information seeking repertoires are a person-centered method of gaining insight into the relationship between Internet use, subjective well-being, and political participation. Through latent profile analysis, three person types were identified in two waves of stratified samples in 18 countries ( N = 8352). In accord with the “augmentation hypothesis,” high levels of interpersonal contact and traditional mass media usage covaried with high Internet use for the highly engaged type, that had highest political participation and life satisfaction, political knowledge, low depressive symptoms and also high anxiety. The other two types fit the “displacement hypothesis,” where Internet-based media displaces traditional media and face-to-face communication. Compared with the digitally immersed, the traditional repertoire was more knowledgeable and politically engaged, and had better well-being. Latent transition analysis showed these repertoires were stable over 6 months. Identifying different types of people with different information seeking styles clarifies mixed results on effects of online mass media use.

AB  - This study is aimed to examine the impact of WeChat use intensity on social isolation, loneliness, and well-being during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the regulatory loop model of loneliness, the notions of Internet Paradox, the Time Displacement hypothesis and previous literature on WeChat use intensity, we propose that lockdown loneliness (partially) mediates the relationship between lockdown WeChat use intensity and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction). Moreover, we assume that lockdown WeChat use intensity moderates the relationship between lockdown social isolation and well-being (i.e., lockdown stress and lockdown life satisfaction) in both a direct and in an indirect way, that is through lockdown loneliness. The results from our Structural Equation Modeling analyses, using a sample of 1,805 Chinese respondents, indicate that all of our research hypotheses are confirmed. From this empirical work, it becomes clear that online social interactions, which are believed by many people to be able to compensate for the lack of offline social interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown period, in fact are endangering their mental health and life satisfaction instead. This article concludes with theoretical and practical implications of our study, followed by its limitations and recommendations for future research.

AB  - In recent years, there have been rising concerns about the impact of online video game play on users' socialization, particularly among adolescent players. The current study addresses one of these concerns and evaluates the potential impact of social displacement on the size and quality of users' social circles due to video game play. Using a representative sample of adolescent players, the results provide support for the emergence of social displacement effects. Increased social online video game play, but not social offline video game play, was found to correspond with smaller, and lower quality, offline social circles. However, further research is needed to assess the impact of these declines on everyday socialization, such its potential negative influence on the development and maintenance of social skills.

              Background
              Screen media is among the most common recreational activities engaged in by children. The displacement hypothesis predicts that increased time spent on screen media activity (SMA) may be at the expense of engagement with other recreational activities, such as sport, music, and art. This study examined associations between non-educational SMA and recreational activity endorsement in 9–10-year-olds, when accounting for other individual (i.e., cognition, psychopathology), interpersonal (i.e., social environment), and sociodemographic characteristics.
            
            
              Methods
              Participants were 9254 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study®. Latent factors reflecting SMA, cognition, psychopathology, and social environment were entered as independent variables into logistic mixed models. Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and household income. Outcome variables included any recreational activity endorsement (of 19 assessed), and specific sport (swimming, soccer, baseball) and hobby (music, art) endorsements.
            
            
              Results
              
                In unadjusted groupwise comparisons, youth who spent more time engaging with SMA were less likely to engage with other recreational activities (
                p
                s < .001). However, when variance in cognition, psychopathology, social environment, and sociodemographic covariates were accounted for, most forms of SMA were no longer significantly associated with recreational activity engagement (
                p
                 > .05). Some marginal effects were observed: for every one SD increase in time spent on games and movies over more social forms of media, youth were at lower odds of engaging in recreational activities (adjusted odds ratio = 0·83, 95% CI 0·76–0·89). Likewise, greater general SMA was associated with lower odds of endorsing group-based sports, including soccer (0·93, 0·88–0·98) and baseball (0·92, 0·86–0·98). Model fit comparisons indicated that sociodemographic characteristics, particularly socio-economic status, explained more variance in rates of recreational activity engagement than SMA and other latent factors. Notably, youth from higher socio-economic families were up to 5·63 (3·83–8·29) times more likely to engage in recreational activities than youth from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results did not suggest that SMA largely displaces engagement in other recreational activities among 9–10-year-olds. Instead, socio-economic factors greatly contribute to rates of engagement. These findings are important considering recent shifts in time spent on SMA in childhood.

AU  - Huang, Yi
AU  - Lu, Jinjin
T2  - Children
AB  - Adolescents’ excessive electronic device use is associated with psychological problems. However, it is unknown which psychological symptom, including emotional symptoms and sleep difficulty, correlates with excessive electronic device use most strongly. Besides, according to the social displacement theory, parent–adolescent communication might mediate the relationship between excessive electronic device use and psychological symptoms. Using the Czech national survey Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) data in the years 2006 (n = 4782) and 2014 (n = 5082), we used network analysis to explore the relationship between psychological symptoms and excessive electronic device use. In addition, we conducted a mediation analysis to examine the role of parent–adolescent communication. The results revealed that excessive electronic device use correlated most strongly with adolescents’ irritability or bad temper, and this conclusion was stable in 2006 and 2014. In 2014, parent–adolescent communication mediated the relationship between adolescents’ excessive electronic device use and their psychological symptoms. The findings suggest that as the internet industry grows, it is essential to improve parent–adolescent communication quality to prevent adolescents’ psychological problems caused by excessive electronic device use.

Method(s): A random sample of 997 university students filled in a self-administered questionnaire using Google form (response rate 81%). The questionnaire adopted a validated scale (Social Media Addiction Scale, SMAS) and included questions about socio-demographics. Grade point average, absences, and passing rate were extracted for each student from the university management system. Result(s): Results showed that each of the three dimensions of addiction to social media (compulsive feelings, social consequences and time displacement) reduce at least one indicator of academic performance (GPA, absenteeism and passing rate). Conclusion(s): Results call to design and evaluate interventions that tackle different social media addiction dimensions to reduce their negative impact on academic performance.

AB  - The present manuscript presents two tests of the hypothesis that social media use decreases social interaction, leading to decreased well-being. Study 1 used the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (N = 2774), which is a national probability sample of Generation X, to test displacement over a three-year time period. Latent change scores were used to test associations among social media adoption in 2009, social media use in 2011, direct contact frequency across years, in relation to change in well-being. Although social media adoption in 2009 predicted less social contact in 2011, increased social media use between 2009 and 2011 positively predicted well-being. Study 2 used experience sampling with a combined community and undergraduate sample (N = 116). Participants reported on their social interactions and passive social media use (i.e., excluding chat via social media) five times a day over five days. Results indicate that social media use at prior times of day was not associated with future social interaction with close others or with future face-to-face interaction. Passive social media use at prior times predicted lower future well-being only when alone at prior times. Neither study supported the social displacement hypothesis. Several interpretations of results, including a need-based account of social media use, are examined. The challenges of identifying an appropriate time scale to study social displacement are identified as critical question for future research.

T2  - New Media & Society
AB  - Drawing from media displacement theory, this article explores which activities are displaced when individuals spend time on social media. Community and undergraduate participants ( N = 135) were randomly assigned to five conditions: no change in social media use, or abstinence from social media for 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or 4 weeks. Participants completed a daily diary measuring how they spent time each day, affective well-being, and quality of day for 28 days. The results indicate that abstinence from social media increased time spent engaged in seven activities, primarily browsing the Internet, working, childcare, and cooking/cleaning. In addition, associations among psychosocial outcomes and the displaced activities were examined. Time spent working, sleeping, and cooking/cleaning were negatively associated with affective well-being and quality of day. On days participants used social media, minutes of use were negatively associated with quality of day. The results suggest that social media primarily displaces unpleasant or neutral activities.

T2  - Child Indicators Research
AB  - Over the last two decades, technologies available to children have accelerated with the advent of wireless internet and increasing portability and affordability of electronic devices. Children's technology use is a rapidly evolving challenge for families, organizing their everyday lives and potentially resulting in social disparities in technology use and displacement of healthy behaviors. This study examined time spent on technology use, physical activity, play, and sleep by US children across early (ages 2-5) and middle (ages 6-11) childhood in two cohorts using time diary data with a focus on variation by class and race. Data came from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement in 1997 (N = 2193) and 2014-2016 (N = 1009). Multivariate regression models estimated total time spent engaged in technology use, physical activity, unstructured play, and sleep. Total time spent engaged with technology increased 32% since 1997 in early childhood and 23% in middle childhood. Technology use was lowest for children with the most highly educated parents. In the more recent cohort, technology use was associated with displacement of physical activity in middle childhood but with increased play in early childhood and increased sleep in middle childhood. Results suggest that changes over time in technology use have restructured children's everyday lives in ways that may be consequential for health and development, but co-occurring declines in physical activity and unstructured play cannot be attributed solely to technology time.

AU  - Exelmans, Liese

T2  - Journal of Sleep Research
AB  - Summary
            This study argues that going to bed may not be synonymous with going to sleep, and that this fragmentation of bedtime results in a two‐step sleep displacement. We separated bedtime (i.e. going to bed) from shuteye time (i.e. attempting to go to sleep once in bed) and assessed the prevalence of electronic media use in both time slots. A convenience sample of 338 adults (aged 18–25 years, 67.6% women) participated in an online survey. Results indicated a gap of 39 min between bedtime and shuteye time, referred to as ‘shuteye latency’. Respondents with a shuteye latency of, respectively, ≤30 min, ≤1 or >1 h, were 3.3, 6.1 and 9.3 times more likely to be rated as poor sleepers compared to those who went to sleep immediately after going to bed. Before bedtime, volume of electronic media use (17 h 55 min per week) was higher than non‐media activities (14 h per week), whereas the opposite was true after bedtime (media = 3 h 41 min, non‐media = 7 h 46 min). Shuteye latency was related exclusively to prebedtime media use. Findings confirmed the proposed fragmentation of bedtime. Sleep displacement should therefore be redefined as a two‐step process, as respondents not only engage in the delay of bedtime, but also in the delay of shuteye time once in bed. Theoretical, methodological and practical implications are discussed.

TI  - Timesplitters: Playing video games before (but not after) school on weekdays is associated with poorer adolescent academic performance. A test of competing theoretical accounts
AU  - Drummond, Aaron

T2  - Computers & Education
AB  - Video games are a common pastime for adolescents. There has been a relatively enduring concern that time spent playing video games might undermine students' academic performance. Hartanto, Toh, and Yang (2018) suggested that frequent gameplay, particularly frequent weekday video gameplay, might displace students' homework; reducing academic performance, albeit by a small amount. Although some evidence has been presented supporting this view, the emerging evidence is mixed. Significant theoretical flaws have also limited our understanding of the relationship between video game play and adolescent academic performance. Here we show that, across approximately 219,000 students, the frequency of video gameplay does not appear to have a systematic relationship with academic performance, confirming the results of earlier research (Drummond & Sauer, 2014). Moreover, although there is a small-moderate reduction in academic performance for some weekday players, this reduction only occurs for players who play in the mornings before school. Players who play in the evenings after school show no meaningful difference in academic performance to non-users. As no existing theoretical accounts of the relationship between gameplay and academic performance adequately explain this finding, we propose that the results most likely support a third variable explanation. That is, video game play does not appear to affect academic results per se. The results further suggest that media psychologists and educational researchers analysing large datasets must be especially diligent when specifying and testing theory, especially with regards to what evidence would effectively falsify such theory. Failing to do so increases the risk of false discovery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research examining online games often focuses on their potential to negatively impact players. One of the most common concerns is that playing online with others can displace offline relationships and, consequently, detrimentally affect one's level of "offline" social support. However, there has been little empirical evidence supporting these causal claims. The current study addresses this by outlining a longitudinal analysis between gaming- and non-gaming-related friendships and social support among a representative sample of social online players (i.e., people who play online video games with others). The results indicate that social online video game play with online or offline friends is not related to perceived social support, positively or negatively, cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Taken together, these results dispute the long-held claims of the social displacement hypothesis and instead suggest that social online video game play does not have negative real-world consequences on players' offline friendships or levels of offline social support.

AB  - Mass media have numerous effects on children, ranging from influencing school performance to increased or reduced aggression. What we do not know, however, is how media availability in the bedroom moderates these effects. Although several researchers have suggested that bedroom media may influence outcomes by displacing other activities (the displacement hypothesis) or by changing the content of media consumed (the content hypothesis), these have rarely been tested directly. This study tested both hypotheses using several outcomes that are associated with bedroom media and some of the underlying mediating mechanisms. The hypotheses were tested using 3 longitudinal samples of varying methods, age, duration, and country. The results indicate that children who have bedroom media are likely to watch larger amounts of screen time which displaced important activities, such as reading and sleeping, which mediated later negative outcomes such as poor school performance. Bedroom media also influence risk for obesity and video game addiction. Children with bedroom media are also likely to be exposed to more media violence. The violent content increased normative beliefs about aggression, which increased physical aggression, providing support for the content hypothesis. This study demonstrates that media can have effects not just from what they show, but also because of what children are not exposed to. Bedroom media are therefore a robust risk factor for several aspects of child development. (PsycINFO Database RecordCopyright (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved).

AU  - Exelmans, Liese
AU  - Van Den Bulck, Jan
T2  - Communication Research
AB  - There is ample evidence that media use displaces sleep, but little theory about the mechanism that explains this. We studied sleep displacement as a self-control issue: People postpone going to bed because they have trouble ending their media exposure. We therefore modeled television viewing (habitual viewing, deficient TV self-regulation, and viewing volume) as a mediator of the effect of trait self-control on bedtime procrastination. A random sample of 821 adults participated in face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Lower self-control was associated with more bedtime procrastination. This relationship was mediated by habitual viewing, which led to less bedtime procrastination, and deficient TV self-regulation, which led to more bedtime procrastination. Evening viewing volume was not a significant mediator. Our results support the idea that (1) self-regulatory failure over television viewing can partly explain the common struggle with bedtime, and (2) strong viewing habits seem to inhibit bedtime procrastination.

AB  - Does communication on social network sites (SNSs) or instant messengers (IMs) reinforce or displace face-to-face (FtF) communication, and how do the 3 channels affect loneliness and life satisfaction? Using cross-lagged structural equation modeling in a longitudinal and representative sample from Germany, we found that SNS communication increased both FtF and IM communication 6 months later. Likewise, IM communication at T1 increased SNS communication at T2. FtF, SNS, and IM communication did not affect loneliness, and FtF and IM communication did not change life satisfaction. However, communication on SNSs slightly increased life satisfaction. Thus, the data indicated that conversing via SNSs and IM has a mainly reinforcing effect and that communicating via SNSs can enhance life satisfaction several months later.

AB  - Background: Screen viewing is a sedentary behaviour reported to interfere with sleep and physical activity. However, few longitudinal studies have assessed such associations in children of preschool age (0-6 years) and none have accounted for the compositional nature of these behaviours. We aimed to investigate the associations between total and device-specific screen viewing time at age 2-3 years and accelerometer-measured 24 h movement behaviours, including sleep, sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at age 5.5 years. Method(s): The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study is an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study in Singapore, which began in June 2009. We recruited pregnant women during their first ultrasound scan visit at two major public maternity units in Singapore. At clinic visits done at age 2-3 years, we collected parent-reported information about children's daily total and device-specific screen viewing time (television, handheld devices, and computers). At 5.5 years, children's movement behaviours for 7 consecutive days were measured using wrist-worn accelerometers. We assessed the associations between screen viewing time and movement behaviours (sedentary behaviour, light physical activity, MVPA, and sleep) using Dirichlet regression, which accounts for the compositional nature of such behaviours. This study is active but not recruiting and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01174875. Finding(s): Between June 1, 2009, and Oct 12, 2010, 1247 pregnant women enrolled and 1171 singleton births were enrolled. 987 children had parent-reported screen data at either 2 or 3 years, of whom 840 attended the clinic visit at age 5.5 years, and 577 wore an accelerometer. 552 children had at least 3 days of accelerometer data and were included in the analysis. Total screen viewing time at age 2-3 years had a significant negative association with sleep (p=0.008), light physical activity (p<0.0001), and MVPA (p<0.0001) in relation to sedentary behaviour at age 5.5 years. Compared with children who spent 1 h or less per day screen viewing at age 2-3 years, children who screen viewed for 3 h or more per day at 2-3 years engaged in more sedentary behaviour (439.8 mins per day [<=1 h screen viewing time] vs 480.0 mins per day [>=3 h screen viewing time]), and less light physical activity (384.6 vs 356.2 mins per day), and MVPA (76.2 vs 63.4 mins per day) at age 5.5 years. No significant differences in time spent sleeping were observed between the groups (539.5 vs 540.4 mins per day). Similar trends were observed for television viewing and handheld device viewing. Interpretation(s): Longer screen viewing time in children aged 2-3 years was associated with more time spent engaged in sedentary behaviour and shorter time engaged in light physical activity and MVPA in later childhood. Our findings indicate that screen viewing might displace physical activity during early childhood, and suggest that reducing screen viewing time in early childhood might promote healthier behaviours and associated outcomes later in life.

AB  - People can show empathic responses to others online, but at the same time empathy has been declining in young people since technology-based communication has become prevalent. Displacement of face-to-face time by online activities would be expected to negatively impact empathic skills. Since there is little direct empirical research on this topic, the present study sought to determine the nature of the relationship between Internet usage and empathy. More than 1000 young adults completed an anonymous online questionnaire that asked about daily media usage, real-world empathy, virtual empathy, social support and demographic information. The results showed that, in general, going online had very small negative impacts upon cognitive and affective real-world empathy and actually improved time spent in face-to-face communication. Video gaming reduced real-world empathy in both females and males but did not reduce face-to-face time. Also, virtual empathy was positively correlated with real-world empathy, although virtual empathy scores were lower than real-world empathy scores for both sexes. Finally, both real-world empathy and virtual empathy are positively related to social support but real-world empathy demonstrated a 5-6 times stronger relationship. The findings show that spending time online does not displace face-to-face time nor reduce real-world empathy, and suggest that perhaps the lack of nonverbal cues in the online world contributes to overall lower levels of virtual empathy compared to the real world. The negative effects of being online upon empathy appear to be due to specific activities such as video gaming rather than total quantity of online time.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the association between telecommunication and other screen devices use and subjective and objective sleep measures in adolescents at 17-18 years. Method(s): Cross-sectional study on adolescents aged 17-18 years from a Spanish population-based birth cohort established in Menorca in 1997-1998. Information on devices use was collected using self-reported questionnaires. Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale was used to assess mobile phone use dependency. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess subjective sleep (n = 226). ActiGraph wGT3X-BT for 7 nights was used to assess objective sleep (n = 110). Result(s): One or more cordless phone calls/week was associated with a lower sleep quality [Prevalence Ratio (PR) 1.30 (95%Confidence Interval (CI) 1.04; 1.62)]. Habitual and frequent problematic mobile phone use was associated with a lower sleep quality [PR 1.55 (95%CI 1.03; 2.33) and PR 1.67 (95%CI 1.09; 2.56), respectively]. Higher tablet use was associated with decreased sleep efficiency and increased minutes of wake time after sleep onset [beta-1.15 (95%CI -1.99; -0.31) and beta 7.00 (95%CI 2.40; 11.60) per increase of 10 min/day of use, respectively]. No associations were found between other devices and sleep measures. Conclusion(s): Frequency of cordless phone calls, mobile phone dependency, and tablet use were related to an increase of subjective and objective sleep problems in adolescents. These results seem to indicate that sleep displacement, mental arousal, and exposure to blue light screen emission might play a more important role on sleep than a high RF-EMF exposure to the brain. However, more studies are needed assessing personal RF-EMF levels to draw conclusions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study is the first to explain the determinant factors of phubbing—checking cell phone during a conversation or while spending time with a significant other—and its effect on the relationship satisfaction of both partners. It is also aimed at determining whether gender and relationship length play moderating roles in a relationship. The study adopted the media displacement theory and the interdependence theory to build a conceptual model of these variables. This cross-sectional research was conducted using an online survey with 741 voluntary married participants from Saudi Arabia. Upon analysis, the data confirmed that problematic usage of cell phone, Internet, social media, games, and SMS had a positive effect on phubbing. Interestingly, it showed that both the sample’s and their partner’s relationship satisfaction increased in line with phubbing behavior. Several theoretical and practical contributions have resulted from these findings.

T2  - Journal of Medical Internet Research
AB  - Background
              COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive internet use amidst this unusual health crisis.
            
            
              Objective
              The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period and to test three hypothesized risk reduction or risk elevation mechanisms, namely social capital–accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects.
            
            
              Methods
              This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 UK and 474 US adult residents at two assessment points 2 months apart.
            
            
              Results
              The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 36% (bootstrap bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] 95% CI 33%-39%) at Time 1 (ie, initial time point) and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI 25%-30%) at Time 2 (ie, follow-up time point). The results supported the social capital–accrual hypothesis by showing that the approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that the avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support.
            
            
              Conclusions
              During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the 2-month study period was high among the UK and US residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.

T2  - Behaviour & Information Technology
AB  - The time displacement hypothesis has been widely used to explain the effects of media use on academic performance. This approach has been criticised for its monocausality and weak explanatory power. Utilising a combination of different theoretical perspectives is better suited than utilising only one. Considering displacement, excitement, attraction and third variable hypothesis, this paper argues that the relation between video game use and school performance is not the same for all types of gamers by considering the influence of socioeconomic, psychological and contextual factors. It investigates how gaming patterns (frequency, time of day) and psychological characteristics (sensation seeking, aggression) are related to academic performance for primary and secondary school students. Five hundred and seven students from five primary and four secondary schools in Singapore participated in a paper-pencil survey. Results showed support for a combination of displacement and third variable hypothesis, as overall time spent on video games was negatively associated with primary school children's and active gamers' school performances. There was no significant relationship for secondary school children. For primary school children who play games in the morning and afternoon, video game use was negatively associated with school performance. There was no support for the attraction and excitement hypotheses. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article has two aims. The first is to show the formative capacity of television beyond its capacity to entertain. The contradictory research results relating television and education are presented and based on some studies done in our context, by us as well as by other researchers, it is defended that television is neither as harmful, nor displaces other activities, nor favours as high a use as sometimes is said. The second is to present some proposals and methodological strategies to use television as an educational resource. The conclusions emphasize the possibility that schools as an instititution should use TV contents and stories/narratives as a means of learning.

AU  - de Reuver, M

T2  - TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - As the fixed and mobile Internet are converging, the question emerges whether consumers expect mobile Internet services to replicate services they know from the fixed Internet. Literature on reinforcement and displacement suggests that the use of new media depends on whether users are inclined to replace or reinforce their existing media use on a new device. This paper analyzes whether the importance that users attribute to using similar services on their mobile phone as on the fixed Internet can explain the intention to adopt mobile services. Specifically, we investigate if such fixed-mobile reinforcement could mediate the impact of personal innovativeness and several dimensions of context. We compare basic Internet services, entertainment services and transaction services. We find that especially the intention to adopt basic Internet services largely depends on the importance of using similar services in the mobile domain as on the fixed Internet. Several context-of-use predictors are partially or even fully mediated by fixed-mobile reinforcement. The results convey a positive message to operators that are betting on converged multimedia services that can be accessed from any device and from any fixed or mobile network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB  - Intellectual property piracy is widely believed, by authorities in both US industry and government, to be rampant in China. Because we lack evidence on the rate at which unpaid consumption displaces paid consumption, we know little about the size of the effect of pirate consumption on the volume of paid consumption. We provide direct evidence on both the volume of unpaid consumption and the rate of sales displacement for movies in China using two surveys administered in late 2008 and mid-2009. First, using a survey of Chinese college students' movie consumption and an empirical approach parallel to a similar recent study of US college students, we find that three quarters of movie consumption is unpaid and that each instance of unpaid consumption displaces 0.14 paid consumption instances. Second, a survey of online Chinese consumers reveals similar patterns of paid and unpaid movie consumption but a displacement rate of roughly zero. We speculate on the small displacement rate finding relative to most of the piracy literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards a communication dialectic: Embedded technology and the enhancement of place
AU  - Purcell, K
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
AB  - Communication literature traditionally divides interaction into two forms: mass media and interpersonal communication. These ideal types are unquestionably useful heuristic tools. Yet their conceptual utility is often undermined when researchers place them at opposite ends of a linear, historical transformation in which mass media technology is believed to supplant interpersonal communication and the locations in which it occurs. This article abandons the polar, historical relationship in favor of a communication dialectic that recognizes the synthesis of ideal types into composite forms of interaction. Embedded technology demonstrates the dialectic by exploring how electronic media fixed within a physical location can combine with the interpersonal communication taking place there to enhance group interaction. The resulting hybrid defies the assumption that mass media simply displace interpersonal interaction, pointing instead to a dialectic relationship in which ideal types continually challenge and transform one another.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS
AB  - Over the last decade, the Internet has become one of the most popular vehicles facilitating a variety of communication and information-sharing tasks worldwide. Its growing popularity as a new medium of communication has resulted in changes in use of traditional media. The purpose of this study was to better understand the uses of online news compared with news use via traditional media. In light of the niche theory and the theory of uses and gratifications, a new medium survives, grows, competes, and prospers by providing utility or gratification to consumers. In doing so, it may have effects on existing media by providing new solutions to old needs or to more contemporary needs. Data were collected in a telephone survey with 211 respondents in the Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County), metropolitan area. The results clearly indicate that the Internet has a competitive displacement effect on traditional media in the daily news domain with the largest displacements occurring for television and newspapers. The findings also show that there is a moderately high degree of overlap or similarity between the niches of the Internet and the traditional media on the gratification-opportunities dimension. In addition, the results suggest that the Internet has the broadest niche on the gratification opportunities dimension, providing users satisfaction with more needs than any of the traditional media on this dimension.

AB  - We address the two measurement issues in the analysis for the effect of free streaming on the consumption of CD and live concerts. One is measurement type for usage of free files and the other is how to measure consumption of ancillary markets, live concerts. Our results indicate that CD purchase is not affected by free streaming use, not supporting the displacement or sampling effect. Meanwhile, results clearly show that streaming use increases the expenditure for music concerts, supporting positive externality of free files. Regarding the measurement issues, we find better goodness-of-fit when we use the continuous time variable rather than the dichotomous dummy for streaming use and find a clearer externality when we use the expenditure rather than frequency for the consumption of concerts.

TI  - Online News Production, Consumption and Immediacy: The Remediation Perspective
AU  - Omar, B
T2  - JURNAL KOMUNIKASI-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - Evidence suggests that media displacement theory has limitation to explain the current development in news industry. This paper turns to the work of Bolter and Grusin on remediation which promotes the idea that old media are being transformed into new digital forms. Anchoring on this idea, this paper offers ways of understanding the processes in which online news sources repurpose print news for digital spaces via remediation. Three processes were identified; (1) borrowing the content and reusing it in a different format, (2) borrowing the format only and not the content, and (3) absorbing the older medium in its entirety. The paper also explores users' experience with new news media and suggests that greater interactivity and user control in online environment indicate the experience of immediacy. To achieve immediacy is the goal of all media, and its manifestation ranges from an improved experience to a sense of being there (or presence) in media use. Linking remediation and literature in journalism studies, this essay contests the straightforward definition of news immediacy and introduces a theoretically driven concept focusing on a sense of presence in news consumption. The dimension of immediacy adds to our knowledge of the complementary use of online and print news media, and is central to the issue of media survival and competition in today's digital age.

AU  - Mukerjee, S
T2  - INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
AB  - How do people in the world's largest democracy consume news online? In this paper, I aim to answer this question by conducting a quantitative assessment of the online news consumption behavior of a large sample of Indian internet users (N approximate to 50,000) over a period of 45 months. In doing so, I contribute to theoretical debates about global news media use, by systematically appraising the prominence and trends in audience share of different types of news sources, thereby shedding light on the digital news consumption landscape of a crucial, but understudied context. Theoretically, I engage with the displacement-complementarity hypothesis and find no evidence that digital-born media have contested the hegemony of legacy media in India online. Next, I investigate the regional-national media divide and find that regional, vernacular media have suffered significant declines in their audience shares over time. This begs the question whether the notion of 'polycentrism' - the idea that the Indian media environment is comprised of national and regional media of equivalent weight - is at all applicable online as it is offline. These findings also run counter to claims of 'internet vernacularization' that have been touted in the past. Finally, I propose the concept of audience mobility, and use it to identify qualitatively distinct dynamics in how vernacular audiences in India have migrated to national vis-a-vis international outlets. The findings and their implications are discussed in light of contemporary changes in Indian society that is characterized by rapid digitization and increasing literacy.

TI  - IT'S TIME TO BE MORE SERIOUS ABOUT ACTIVATING YOUNGSTERS: LESSONS FOR CHILDHOOD OBESITY
AU  - Hills, AP
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXERCISE SCIENCE & FITNESS
AB  - The epidemic of obesity is impacting an increasing proportion of children, adolescents and adults with a common feature being low levels of physical activity (PA). Despite having more knowledge than ever before about the benefits of PA for health and the growth and development of youngsters, we are only paying lip-service to the development of motor skills in children. Fun, enjoyment and basic skills are the essential underpinnings of meaningful participation in PA. A concurrent problem is the reported increase in sitting time with the most common sedentary behaviors being TV viewing and other screen-based games. Limitations of time have contributed to a displacement of active behaviors with inactive pursuits, which has contributed to reductions in activity energy expenditure. To redress the energy imbalance in overweight and obese children, we urgently need out-of-the-box multisectoral solutions. There is little to be gained from a shame and blame mentality where individuals, their parents, teachers and other groups are singled out as causes of the problem. Such an approach does little more than shift attention from the main game of prevention and management of the condition, which requires a concerted, whole-of-government approach (in each country). The failure to support and encourage all young people to participate in regular PA will increase the chance that our children will live shorter and less healthy lives than their parents. In short, we need novel environmental approaches to Foster a systematic increase in PA. This paper provides examples of opportunities and challenges For PA strategies to prevent obesity with a particular emphasis on the school and home settings. [J Exerc Sci Fit . Vol 7 . No 2 (Suppl) .

TI  - Television and Academic Achievement: Evidence from the Digital Television Transition in the UK
AU  - Castro, AN
T2  - ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - This paper exploits exogenous variation in the transition date from an analogue to digital television signal in the UK across more than 32,000 geographical units to examine the causal impact of television on academic performance and potential mechanisms. Using a large administrative dataset on the universe of students in public education in England, I show that the switchover increased pupil test scores and that the effect is driven by economically disadvantaged students. Using TV market data and a child survey dataset, I investigate possible mechanisms. I show that the digital transition considerably increased TV viewing time and displaced forms of socialisation associated with risky behaviour for disadvantaged children.

AU  - Heyman, JL

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionAs smartphones have become increasingly integrated into people's lives, researchers have attempted to answer whether they are beneficial or detrimental to well-being. Of particular interest to the current study is the role that smartphones played during the first year of the COVID-19 Pandemic. MethodsIn an intensive longitudinal study, we explore how varying uses of smartphones relate to well-being using the Displacement-Interference-Complementarity framework. ResultsConsistent with pre-pandemic research, we show that people felt better, calmer, and more energetic when they used their phones more for complementary purposes (i.e., to access information, entertainment, and connection not otherwise available). In contrast to most pre-pandemic research, however, we find no evidence that any type of phone use predicted lower well-being during the pandemic. DiscussionOverall, this study lends support to the idea that smartphones can be beneficial for individuals, particularly during times when face-to-face interaction is limited.

T2  - DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine structural and psychological factors that may affect disaster evacuees' usage of different media channels in a multichannel media environment.Design/methodology/approach - The present study uses the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake in Japan as the case study. It adopts a quantitative approach using structural equation modelling with data collected from an original questionnaire survey (n = 744).Findings - The results show that the evacuees' usage of almost all media channels is positively related to the number of different types of media terminals they had. That said, those who were evacuated mandatorily tend to utilise internet-enabled media channels more. It is also found that traditional broadcast and internetenabled media channels complement each other instead of displacing. Thus, multichannel appears to be an effective means for disseminating disaster information. However, it is also found that having access to a particular media channel does not necessarily mean that people will utilise it. Practical implications - To fully utilise the multichannel media environment for disaster information dissemination, governments and media organisations also need to focus on the quality of the information being disseminated over both traditional broadcast and internet-enabled media channels.Originality/value - Few studies have empirically examined factors that affect disaster evacuees' usage of differentmedia channels in a multichannel media environment. This study fills this gap and the findings may help governments and media organisations in utilising multiple media channels to disseminate disaster information.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background/objective: Parents of preschoolers' report using screen media frequently. More frequent screen use by parents may undermine child development by displacing time for foundational parent-child interactions. The objective of the present study is to examine the extent to which parent screen use contributes to child global development 1 year later.Methods: Data are from a cohort of 315 preschoolers from Nova Scotia, Canada and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents reported the number of hours per day they spent using screens, as well as child screen time and sex, and parent educational attainment. Our outcome is child global development scores, which combine assessments of communication, cognitive, personal-social, and motor skills measured at 4.5 using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) (N = 249, 79% retained).Results: Parents in our sample spent on average 6.35 h per day using screen media outside of work (SD = 3.07) and children spent on average 3.43 h per/day using screens. Multivariate linear regression indicated that each 1-h increase in parents daily screen media use, corresponded to a 1.25 decrease in child global development scores, B = -1.25 p < 0.05, 95% CI between -2.37 and -0.13.Conclusion: Our results indicate that parent screen use may represent a key component of children's media ecology. Given the importance of global development in early childhood for later health and achievement, the present results suggest that interventions should include parent screen use habits in media wellness interventions.

TI  - MASS MEDIA AND THEIR ABILITY TO GRATIFY PERSONAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS
AU  - Gluskowska, J
AU  - Rowinski, T
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY, THE PERSON AND THE TECHNOLOGIES OF THE XXI CENTURY
AB  - On the basis of U&G Theory from Katz, Blumer and Gurevitch's perspective, (1974) there was an attempt to answer the question whether mass media, i.e. books, press, radio, television, cinema movies and the Internet differ from one another in the ability to gratifypersonal and social needs. Assumptions of this theory underline relationship between mass communication technology (also in the way of development) and human needs. It seems that mass communication technologies develop according to evolutionary perspective (Levinson, 1997). The best fitting of technologies to nature of the human communication can be purpose and cause of its existing. Some of the human needs, which are gratified by mass media are identified.Mass media employ common reasons for media use comprising four fundamental categories by McQuail (2001): information, personal identity, integration and social interaction, entertainment. Moreover, explorations concerned determining the position of the Internet on the media scene of the 21st century in the aspect of functional alternative for traditional media, as well as non-media gratification sources.Participants included 179 students who with "paper-pencil" method filled in the survey forms of the Media Gratification Force J. Gluskowska (Cronbach's alpha coefficient: press 0,85; book - 0,87; cinema movies- 0,85; radio - 0,90; TV- 0,91; Internet - 0,89; non-media gratification - 0,91 as well as Sensation Seeking Scale by Zuckerman in the Polish adaptation by Oleszlkiewicz- Zsurzs (Cronbach's alpha coefficient: G-0, 85; TAS-0, 82; ES-0, 87; DIS-0,81; BS-0,82; 1-0,77).Research results have proved that mass media in fact differ in the ability to gratify needs. The Internet has taken the first position on this plane leaving the other media a long way behind. This peculiar omnimedium 'absorbed' traditional means of mass communication. Thus it can be said that after the technological explosion of the 20th c. we have been experiencing the prophetic vision by McLuhan related to "mass media implosion" triggered by the development of electronic media. Additionally, the assumption related to the Internet as a functional alternative for non-media gratification sources. There has been evidence for the correlation between the amount of time spent online and Sensation Seeing Scale (BS) by Zuckerman, also there have been significance intersexual differences in relation to particular needs. The budget of time devoted to mass media may indicate that there exists a "displacement effect" (Himmelweit, 1983). The Internet has been slowly replacing traditional media - as far as time and also possibility for gratifying particular needs are concerned by technological development.Continuous ICT development determines change in theoretical attitude towards an active user and that is why U&G is in its heyday. Raising and interactivity of the media compel one to look at the ICT phenomena from human's perspective (their needs etc.). Looking forward at (satisfying needs) U&G it could be assumed, that this perspective allow better understand technological evolution and information society evaluation.

T2  - Social Science Computer Review
AB  - This report compares the cultural participation and other free time activities of heavy users, light users, and nonusers of personal computers, based on a 1997 national survey of more than 6,000 respondents aged 18 years or older conducted for the National Endowment for the Arts. No significant or consistent evidence of time displacement of such leisure activities was found. Indeed, heavier computer use was associated with significantly greater participation in cultural and other free time activities, even after multivariate adjustment. These results reinforce conclusions from earlier surveys showing higher mass media use among home computer users rather than displacement, as occurred with the introduction of television. These results reinforce the conclusion that personal computers might have more in common with "time-enhancing" home appliances such as the telephone than they do with television.

T2  - Communication Research
AB  - The theory of the niche predicts that a new medium will compete with established media for consumer satisfaction, consumer time, and/or consumer advertising dollars. Competition between e-mail and telephone use was measured in this study, with a total of 309 Ss, at the level of gratifications derived by consumers. Gratifications and gratification opportunities (consumers' beliefs that a medium allows them to obtain greater opportunities for satisfaction) were derived from an analysis of open-ended questions. A 2nd sample was interviewed by telephone and rated both mediums on gratification and gratification-opportunity scales. 48% of respondents reported using the phone less since they adopted e-mail. Results indicate that a wider spectrum of needs is being served by the telephone, whereas e-mail provides greater gratification opportunities. The results indicate competition, but also indicate that the 2 mediums are not close substitutes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media
AB  - Examined the effects of parental guidance on children's use of 4 types of media, the perception of the child, and gender differences. 519 children (aged 9-13 yrs) completed questionnaires concerning daily television use and parents' guidance behavior concerning television, computer games, books, and comics. Results show that restrictive guidance led to a reduction of media consumption, whereas other forms of guidance did not. Restriction of the use of 1 medium was associated with increases in another medium offering a similar gratification. Ss' perceived differences between the guidance behavior of fathers and mothers. Parental guidance as measured as verbal cues affected media consumption of girls only. It is concluded that parental guidance effects should be measured separately for males and females and that guidance should be analyzed from the child's point of view.

T2  - Journal of Constructivist Psychology
AB  - This work seeks to analyze phenomenologically the shifts in the structure of experience inaugurated by the advent of electronic media, especially the Internet. This analysis includes descriptions of how the Internet transforms human experience across dimensions of temporality, embodiment, spatiality, and sociality. It is argued that electronic media transforms the lived meanings of temporality and embodiment as the ground of human experience. These transformations allow us to gain instant access to a broader world of experience, but also pose unique challenges to our capacity to form community. The simultaneous availability of multiple "channels" of information from multiple sources in the electronic milieu transforms the lived meanings of temporality and embodiment that are foundational in forming the shared mythic narratives that bind us together as communities (see R. May, 1991). In transforming the ecstatic unity of time and displacing the centrality of the body in experience, electronic media inaugurates substantial shifts in our habitual modes of living time, embodiment, and others. Implications of these shifts for community and selfhood are explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Mass Communication & Society
AB  - This study examines the growing DVD home theater phenomenon by mapping the characteristics of DVD home theater adopters and their attitudes toward the new technology, which entered the mass market in 1997 as a competitor to the VCR. It attempts to locate and differentiate DVD adopters based on patterns of media use, utilities from gratification, socialization, and displacement. Based on Q methodology with a sample of 38 American respondents, 3 distinct groups are evident: audiophiles, technophiles, and recreation seekers. Audiophiles use DVD to pursue audio quality, whereas technophiles are the early adopters who are drawn to the new technology and its potential. Recreation seekers use the DVD to satisfy a need for entertainment, enjoyment, and escape. These groups are guided by different goals and gratifications and hence exhibit different patterns of use, diffusion, and displacement, although they all agree that their DVD adoption was motivated by the DVD's technological quantum leap over the VCR.

AB  - This study measured to what extent consumers used the internet to displace or reinforce the use of other media as sources of advertising information. The sample was 2,032 households from 5,031 households randomly selected from a midwestern state. The results showed that although internet advertising provided many unique features, it has not displaced most media as sources of advertising information. Many consumers found that internet advertising was a complementary medium based on their favorable attitudes or frequent use of other media advertising. The research also indicated that the reinforcement effects will be likely more evident for the future use of internet advertising associated with the use of billboards, direct mail, magazines, and television. However, the displacement effects may continue to occur for the future use of internet advertising associated with the future use of free community papers and weekly paid papers as advertising sources.

AB  - Videotapes of in-home television viewing of 50 individuals in five age groups (2-, 5-, 8-, and 12 year-olds, and adults), recorded over a 10-day period, revealed that 46% of time with television was spent in some activity instead of or in addition to looking at the TV. Social interaction was the most common nonviewing activity for all viewers, followed by playing and eating for children and reading for adults. Women were more likely than all other groups to do chores. Nonviewing behaviors occurred most often during programming that attracted less visual attention, particularly ads. Except for 2 year-olds, children's attention dropped during ads to a greater extent than did that of adults. The findings have implications for theories of television use and impact including uses and gratifications, displacement, and formal feature theory.

The relative popularities and frequencies of use of the different services were established, and it appears that individuals use the Internet most where it is readily and freely available. Gender and age significantly influenced patterns of use, but there were remarkably few significant associations with individual differences in personality when gender and age were controlled for. Exploratory factor analysis of the frequency of use data for individual services revealed the presence of 4 inter-correlated factors, which have been identified as Work, Social, Use-at-home, and Leisure. A consideration of the overt purposes for using individual services was not sufficient to identify the factors; it was also necessary to take into account the location at which services were accessed. It has been concluded that individuals' use of the Internet can be regarded, at least in part, as a form of displacement activity, engaged in when there is nothing else to do or when the task in hand is not especially attractive.

TI  - Children at play?
AU  - Dill, Karen E
T2  - Human Development
AB  - Reviews the book Kids and Media in America by Donald Roberts and Ulla Foehr (2004). The book is an in-depth report about how American children spend their free time. As such it does not delve deeply into the content of the media or media effects. Also, a large portion of the book reads very much like an expanded Results and Discussion section of a journal article. There are ten chapters. There are short summaries dispersed throughout these readings, and each chapter ends with a broader summary. Roberts and Foehr describe current patterns of children's media use in their book. Given the sheer amount of current childhood media use reported, it is clear that this source of learning and socialization significantly affects the modern experience of childhood. What used to be considered play time is now almost exclusively media time. Not only is this a cause for concern because of the effects associated with the content of our media (e.g., aggression, eating disorders, poor school performance), but also it is a real loss of the activities that this astounding amount of media use displaces, such as physical activity and the time our children devote to using their imaginations. The authors employ a level of analysis of media use that is deeper than appears elsewhere by asking questions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A 1-month panel study of an immersive online video game investigated its social and civic impact. The data revealed mixed effects: Although the game led to an improved global outlook and some online community improvements, some kinds of existing friendships eroded and the most social players became more insular. Family interactions were unaffected. News media use was unaffected, but entertainment media were displaced. A decline in face-to-face interactions was detected and described as "cocooning." The results are discussed, along with their implications for theory and for the study of both video games and the Internet more broadly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The influence of the media environment on physical activity: Looking for the big picture.
AU  - Maibach, Edward
T2  - American Journal of Health Promotion
AB  - In this paper, the media environment is examined, in an attempt to better understand its influence on one mechanism hypothesized to be underlying the obesity epidemic, decreased physical activity. Even this modest undertaking, however, is fraught with uncertainty because of a paucity of evidence. Although firm conclusions and action-oriented recommendations are the objective of this review, the state of the evidence may be better suited to starting a discussion than to ending it. The first two sections examine trends in physical activity and the media environment, respectively, in the United States over the past several decades. The third section examines opportunities to influence the media environment for the purpose of promoting physical activity. The final section presents research questions, the answers to which will enhance our certainty as to the best path forward. The literature points to several facets of the media environment that are useful to consider: its delivery platforms and channels; the amount of media consumed through those platforms; the content of the media that is consumed; and the commercial purpose of most media content. The displacement effect appears to be an important mechanism by which the media environment is contributing to the decline in physical activity. Even the large marketing budgets associated with commercial physical activity products and services are small in comparison to marketing budgets for other commercial categories.

AU  - Rasanen, Pekka
AU  - Kouvo, Antti
T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - It is often assumed that the increased use of the new information and communication technology (ICT) can displace traditional face-to-face sociability. At the same time, it has been argued that the new ICT can also strengthen traditional forms of sociability. This article evaluates these opposite views by examining how the frequency of Internet use is connected with two forms of sociability: civic engagement and interpersonal involvement. Empirical interest is narrowed down to four European countries. The data utilized are the Finnish, British, French and Italian sections of the European Social Survey 2002-2003 (N = 6,762). The methods of analysis include cross-tabulations and logistic regression models. The findings indicate that frequent Internet use is positively associated with both forms of sociability in all countries. However, there are also cross-country differences in the strength of these associations and in the effects of sociodemographic control variables. The findings thus suggest that the contemporary development of the information society has different implications for different types of societies.

T2  - Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
AB  - The aim of this study was to contrast the validity of two opposing explanatory hypotheses about the effect of online communication on adolescents' well-being. The displacement hypothesis predicts that online communication reduces adolescents' well-being because it displaces time spent with existing friends, thereby reducing the quality of these friendships. In contrast, the stimulation hypothesis states that online communication stimulates well-being via its positive effect on time spent with existing friends and the quality of these friendships. We conducted an online survey among 1,210 Dutch teenagers between 10 and 17 years of age. Using mediation analyses, we found support for the stimulation hypothesis but not for the displacement hypothesis. We also found a moderating effect of type of online communication on adolescents' well-being: Instant messaging, which was mostly used to communicate with existing friends, positively predicted well-being via the mediating variables (a) time spent with existing friends and (b) the quality of these friendships. Chat in a public chatroom, which was relatively often used to talk with strangers, had no effect on adolescents' well-being via the mediating variables.

TI  - The relationship between television viewing and obesity in young children: A review of existing explanations.
AU  - Jenvey, Vickii B
T2  - Early Child Development and Care
AB  - It has often been proposed that young (three to six years old) children's television viewing habits contribute to early-onset obesity. Three explanations that link television viewing patterns of young children with the development of obesity are considered. First, television viewing displaces time available for physical activity, reduces energy expenditure relative to energy intake and leads to obesity. Second, the cognitive immaturity of young children increases their susceptibility to persuasive intent of advertisements for foods of poor nutritional quality. Such food advertisements are broadcast often during children's television programmes and lead to unhealthy food preferences, and dietary imbalances associated with obesity. Third, activity displacement combined with susceptibility to persuasive intent of televised food advertisements predispose young children to early-onset obesity. Research evidence in support of each explanation is questionable, because of conceptual and methodological shortfalls in existing research. How future research might address shortfalls is considered.

T2  - Computers, phones, and the Internet: Domesticating information technology.
AB  - This chapter focuses on the impact of computers and technology on the larger community. The authors' field site is a midsized American university town in a rural setting, which has had one of the longest standing community networks in the United States. Eighty-seven percent of the town's residents use the Internet on a regular basis, and 75% of the town's businesses advertise online. In this well-connected community, approximately 5% of web traffic is local, connecting to Internet hosts located in the area. Although by no means the dominant focus of Internet activity in the town, use of local Internet services and content is strong. The researchers conclude that many residents recruit Internet technology in the service of their community-oriented goals (e.g., activism, staying informed, participating in groups). Yet when people do not have these community-oriented goals, increased use of the Internet may actually decrease their level of activity in the community. The Internet can therefore both complement and displace community activities, with the effects being different for different people. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The prevalence of obesity in American youth has reached alarming levels. The proportion of overweight children and adolescents, defined as a body mass index (BMI) exceeding the ninety-fifth percentile for age and sex based norms, has tripled in the past three decades. The recent spike in childhood obesity rates has accelerated scholarly activity aimed at understanding the causes and contributors to this dramatic increase. A portion of this activity has focused on the relationship between electronic media use (particularly television use) and childhood obesity. There are three major hypothesized mechanisms for the relationship between electronic media use and obesity (Robinson, 2001). These mechanisms include: (1) decreased metabolic rates during television viewing specifically; (2) displacement of physical activity (sedentary behavior); and (3) increased caloric intake (either through eating while watching, or in response to electronically delivered food advertisements and food marketing). Our goals in this chapter are twofold: (1) to present each of these hypotheses, and review existing empirical evidence for each; and (2) to discuss limitations of existing research, and suggest directions for future research in this area.

AB  - In order to track social change during a period of the rapid advances brought about by new information technologies (IT), a targeted module of IT-relevant and Internet questions was added to the 2000, 2002 and 2004 samples of the General Social Survey (GSS). The general issue inherent in and guiding the questions asked (as well as the analyses conducted) is whether IT functions to displace or expand various daily activities. In general, Internet use was not correlated with lower use of other personal communications or mass communications media-nor with lower levels of other social activities like church attendance or arts participation. In many cases the Internet was associated with increased use of other media or activities. Respondents who spend the most time on the Internet did report fewer social visits by relatives and neighbors, and perhaps less frequent sexual intercourse, but more visits with friends, compared to those who spent no time on the Internet.

AB  - Media effect studies on children have focused on time spent with media relative to some outcome. We argue that researchers should examine quantity as the sole measure of media input only when it is of theoretical significance. In most circumstances media content and form are more important than time spent. A media diet metaphor is proposed as an alternative approach that includes both amount of exposure and program content across media platforms. Quantity is relevant primarily for hypotheses that concern time displacement (such as TV viewing displacing physical exercise) or other medium-general effects. In addition, technological advances have not yet been exploited that can allow new methodologies for studying media use and impact. As examples, eye tracking and magnetic resonance imaging are discussed to illustrate how new approaches can provide researchers with opportunities to ask different questions and to provide new perspectives on old questions.

AB  - The theory of niche proposes that a new medium competes with older, more established media to fulfill users' needs. This study uses niche theory, a macrolevel theory, as well as social information processing theory and the theory of electronic propinquity, both microlevel theories, to examine the niche of instant messaging (IM) in providing general gratifications. Results indicate that IM is characterized by a broad niche, surpassed only by that of the cell phone. IM had substantial niche overlap with e-mail and the cell phone, indicating a degree of substitutability between them; the least overlap was with the landline telephone (LLP). The hierarchy that emerged indicated that the cell phone was superior to IM, which was superior to e-mail, followed by the LLP for providing general gratifications. Finally, displacement tests indicated that IM use displaced e-mail and LLP but not cell phone use. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Media use vs. work and play in middle childhood.
AU  - Hofferth, Sandra L
T2  - Social Indicators Research
AB  - As new media continue to be introduced, they become especially troubling for educators, who fear that children will grow up as zombies, lacking creativity, inspiration, and literacy-and becoming sedentary and overweight. This brief article analyzes how media use is nested in children's everyday lives. In particular, it focuses on the hypothesis of media displacement of other activities. According to the displacement hypothesis, media displace creative activities (such as free play), achievement-related activities (like reading and studying), and physical activities. In this article, "play" refers to unstructured noncomputer leisure-time activities not directly related to school, including indoor and outdoor play. Achievement-related activities (such as studying and reading) are the "work" of children in middle childhood. Physical activities include time in structured sports and in walking/hiking outdoors. Time spent in a new activity has to come from another previous activity, leading to the expectation that many other activities will decline. The results support the concerns of those who fear that media interfere with other activities. Of particular concern is that in both years, children's nonmedia play hours and their sleep hours are shorter with greater media use. Play and sleep both seem to offer large blocks of children's time from which new activities can be carved out. Video game playing and television viewing are negatively associated with reading, study and outdoor activities, again suggesting potential negative effects on achievement and physical activity of extensive media use. The large amount of time spent watching television provides a large pool of available time from which to expand new media and may reflect a medium that will decline in the future.

AU  - Okazaki, Shintaro

T2  - International Journal of Advertising: The Quarterly Review of Marketing Communications
AB  - The purpose of this investigation is to examine media displacement-reinforcement effects between traditional media, PC internet and mobile internet. The theoretical foundations draw on niche theory and enduring involvement, and adopt the satisfaction-attitude-loyalty chain as a core model. The surveys were conducted in Japan and resulted in 992 responses from a general consumer sample. Two scenarios (dining out and travel planning) were created to manipulate the level of enduring involvement. Our data fit the proposed model reasonably well, supporting 12 out of 14 hypotheses. The findings indicate that the more satisfied consumers are with traditional media and mobile internet, the more likely they are to perceive PC internet unfavourably as an alternative information source in both involvement situations. However, a favourable attitude towards mobile internet could act as a reinforcement motivator to use PC internet in high-involvement situations. Therefore, our findings support cross-media campaigns in high-involvement situations. In closing, significant limitations are recognised, and future research directions suggested.

T2  - Wired youth: The social world of adolescence in the information age.
AB  - The debate on the social impact of information and communication technologies is particularly important for the study of adolescent life, because through their close association with friends and peers, adolescents develop life expectations, school aspirations, world views, and behaviours. This book presents an up-to-date review of the literature on youth sociability, relationship formation, and online communication, examining the way young people use the internet to construct or maintain their inter-personal relationships. Using a social network perspective, the book systematically explores the various effects of internet access and use on adolescents' involvement in social, leisure and extracurricular activities, evaluating the arguments that suggest the internet is displacing other forms of social ties. The core of the book investigates the motivations for online relationship formation and the use of online communication for relationship maintenance. The final part of the book focuses on the consequences, both positive and negative, of the use of online communication, such as increased social capital and online bullying. Wired Youth is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students of adolescent psychology, youth studies, media studies and the psychology and sociology of interpersonal relationships.

T2  - New Media & Society
AB  - Scholars have recently begun investigating teenagers' perceptions of digital devices and awareness of the functions they serve in their lives (Campbell, 2007: Cheong, 2008; Heim et al., 2007; Ling, 2004). This article aligns with research on adolescents' uses of digital media devices by conducting focus groups with 80 middle- and high-school teenagers. The chief objective of this research was to further our understanding of what young people think about digital devices (e.g. cell phones, video game systems, the internet) and the functions they serve in their lives. Four themes emerged from 11 focus group interviews: (1) an awareness of digital devices; (2) a sense of temporal displacement; (3) social functions; and (4) a palpable sense of risk associated with using them. These themes resonate with the current literature. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

The results show that international mail, domestic telephone and telex can be best described by a quadratic indicating they are undergoing disadoption while the trends for domestic mail and international telephone calls show exponential growth. Correlations confirmed that new media have displaced international mail, domestic telephone and telex, yet they do not substitute for domestic letters and international telephone calls. Finally, television, mobile telephones and the internet are at the exponential or logistic growth stage and supplement each other. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Communication Research
AB  - By unpacking different forms of Internet and massively multiplayer online game (MMO) use, the present study adopts a nuanced approach to examine the connections between online activities and psychosocial well-being. It combined self-reported survey data with unobtrusive behavioral data from server logs of a large virtual world, EverQuest II. Over 5,000 players were surveyed about how they use the Internet, their specific activities in the virtual world, and their psychosocial well-being. In-game communication networks were also constructed and analyzed. The results showed support for both time displacement and social augmentation effects for various activities. Whether Internet and MMO use were associated with negative or positive outcomes was largely dependent on the purposes, contexts, and individual characteristics of users. The results suggest that Internet use and game play have significant nuances and should not be considered as monolithic sources of effects.

T2  - Social Indicators Research
AB  - Alarm about the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity has focused attention on individual lifestyle behaviours that may contribute to unhealthy weight. Television viewing is often a focus of the obesity debate. Not only is it sedentary, it also has the potential to influence other lifestyle behaviours either by displacing physical activities or through the consumption of high energy snack foods while watching TV. The research reported here uses data from 2,143 Australian 6-7 year children to examine the lifestyle behaviours associated with excess weight. These children spent 90 min each day watching television, 100 min each day in physical activity, and 39% consumed high levels of snack foods. Nearly one in five (18%) were overweight or obese. After adjustment for family and child characteristics, more time spent watching television was associated with more snacking and less physical activity. However, television viewing was associated with children's weight status, but snacking and physical activities were not. These findings confirm the existence from a young age, of a cluster of lifestyle behaviours that are associated with unhealthy weight status.

AB  - As few studies utilized longitudinal design to examine the development of Internet use for communication, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of gender and initial Internet use for communication on subsequent use. The study sample was 280 undergraduate students who were assessed at five time points. Hierarchical linear models were used to analyze longitudinal data regarding the development of three Internet mediums, email, instant messaging, and chat. The negative correlation between initial status and growth rate demonstrated that students using one particular medium relatively heavily tended to grow slower, and thus students with low initial use of a medium increased their use of that medium faster and thus closed the gap between students with low and high initial status. Findings about the use of a certain medium on the use of others were mixed with four models supporting neither displacement nor augmentation hypothesis and two remaining models supporting the displacement hypothesis.

AB  - The recent growth of mobile channels has provided steadily increasing opportunities for individuals to access news and other mass-mediated content. Media ecological perspectives argue that the introduction of such new technologies can shift the existing biases in prevailing social systems. According to one ecological perspective, the theory of the niche, when new media technologies are successfully introduced into a domain, displacement may occur unless some alteration is made to the resource base. Interstices are conceptualized as the gaps in the routines of media users between scheduled activities. Through the use of a diary method, participants logged access to news using a variety of communication technologies, including mobile channels. Results indicated that traditional media occupied traditional niches with little evidence of displacement, while mobile channels occupied a new niche: access in the interstices.

AU  - Robinson, John P
T2  - Social Indicators Research
AB  - The study of how people spend time dates back more than 100 years. Serious attention to its societal policy implications was undertaken in Soviet Russia soon after its revolution in the early 1920s and continued into the 1970s. These were preludes of the Multinational Time-Budget Research Project, the brainchild of internationally distinguished mathematician Alexander Szalai, who had the vision to understand how applying the full measurement properties of the classic quantitative variable of time to how people spend it had enormous scientific, policy and philosophical implications. As TV was beginning to diffuse in the 1950s, several empirical studies were undertaken by scholars and media organizations to document the enormous effects TV was obviously having on society. In addition to documenting the nascent "gender revolution" in work and housework, Szalai's pioneering efforts have resulted in providing clear evidence of how TV has revolutionized daily life. It is a change that truly revolutionized time, perhaps reflecting how TV has universally meant trading short-term pleasure for long-term dysfunction.

T2  - Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications
AB  - It has often been shown that the amount of media use is negatively related to cognitive outcomes. The more time spent on media the poorer cognitive performance is. This association has mainly been found for general-audience, violent, and action-loaded contents but not for educational contents. Typically, long-term-explanations like the time-displacement hypothesis are considered to account for this relation, although this cannot fully explain the association. Additionally short-term explanations should be considered, since it can be expected that media-induced stress can impair information processing. The present study compares short-term effects regarding memory performance and the ability to concentrate, using four different experimental conditions (high- vs. low-arousing films and video games). It was also examined if the experienced level of stress mediates group differences and if habitual media, habitual use of age-restricted contents or the trait sensation seeking moderate this mediation. Participants consisted of N = 117 university students. They were asked to learn written items before media use and to recall these after having used the media. Further, the ability to concentrate was measured. Experimental groups differed with regard to the cognitive outcome measures after media use. A significant univariate difference was found for high- vs. low-arousing contents in general (independent of type of media), the high-arousing content leading to poorer ability to concentrate after media use. The expected mediating and moderating effects are not supported. The study yields evidence that short-term mechanisms might play a role in explaining the negative correlations between media use and cognitive performance.

AB  - Twenty-five years after George Gerbner and colleagues' seminal report on television and science attitudes, there is a need to update the data on television's portrayals of science and to revisit the cultivation question. We address this need by analyzing 21st-century television depictions of science and examining the relationships between exposure to television and attitudes toward science with an analysis of 2006 General Social Survey data. Content results show that scientists appear infrequently in prime-time dramatic programs, are typically White males, and are frequently cast in good or mixed roles rather than as evil scientists. Regarding the cultivation effect, we do not find a significant direct relationship between television viewing and negative attitudes toward science after relevant controls are taken into account. Additional results, however, indicate a displacement effect of television viewing on science attitudes and show significant interaction effects consistent with mainstreaming.

T2  - Journal of Infant, Child & Adolescent Psychotherapy
AB  - Many older adults are concerned that new internet technologies, especially social media, add to the alienation and isolation of children and young adults. The author considers these concerns in relation to two child psychotherapies by skilled therapists, in which the patients used cyberdevices. The play-like functions of these uses are discussed, including displacement, defense and communication. Since the child patients introduced cyberdevices that were developed in the earlier phases of technology development, rather than the more contemporary, web-based social media, some emerging questions remain unanswered. Nonetheless, the therapists' deft and sensitive handling of the patients' uses of technology suggests that many of the established psychodynamic approaches are appropriate to the new situations.

T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been placed on improving access to Information and Communication Technology in the United States. With the rapidity at which broadband construction projects are dotting America, it is important to understand the social impacts of these infrastructural projects. One particularly salient issue is whether access to the Internet would decrease the involvement of youth in their home communities since youth and issues of talent retention are crucial to the long-term viability of rural communities. However, findings on this topic have been a mixed bag with some studies suggesting that the use of online social networking decreases community involvement while others have found that it may maintain or even increase community involvement. This study set out to clarify the conflicting findings and in the process, it has found support for both the displacement effect as well as an augmentation effect. The dual processes suggest that merely examining time spent on social networking sites does not provide a complete picture of the effects of Internet use on community involvement. The nature of the interactions and the participants in the online social networking also play an important role. For rural community leaders working towards the long-term viability of their communities, the findings suggest that efforts should be directed towards mitigating the displacement effects of Internet use while harnessing popular Internet applications such as social networking sites to augment the involvement that youth have in their home communities.

AU  - Goldstein, Jeffrey
T2  - The Oxford handbook of the development of play.
AB  - Toys have always reflected the latest developments in science and technology, from music boxes to electric trains to computer games and robots. This chapter considers how children learn to play with modern technology, and what they learn through that play. Playful learning, or guided learning (see Fisher, et al., this volume), is illustrated through selected studies conducted in schools, homes, hospitals, and play settings. Children often use smart toys in traditional ways, bypassing the technology. There is little research on whether smart toys increase children's cognitive or social skills, although some toys are designed with these goals in mind. Electronic toys and digital games keep children on task for a longer period of time. New media do not necessarily displace older media so much as add to the range of play options available. Children learn to use new technologies largely through trial and error-through exploration, experimentation, and play-and in collaboration with others, both face to face and online. A computer game Is learned by playing it. The typical computer game involves a range of cognitive activities: remembering, hypothesis testing, and strategic planning. Games involve written text, visual environments, and speech. Examples are given of videogames in health, education, medicine, and science. Modern technologies are also used to study play, with data collected via the Internet, with mobile phones and video cameras. Global positioning systems allow researchers to study play in vivo, tracing children's outdoor movement over time. New forms of play objects and interactivity bring with them questions about our relationship with nature and with one another. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is growing concern regarding the influence of media exposure on American children's health and development. The current prospective study tested the direct relations between media exposure, sleep, and various health outcomes (e.g. attention problems, aggression, and body composition) and the indirect effect of media exposure through sleep disturbances. Child participants (N = 1,317) completed measures of media consumption and sleep. Teachers reported on children's attention problems and use of physical aggression. Results showed that media exposure at Time 1 was indirectly related to attention, physical aggression, and Body Mass Index at Time 3 (13 months later), mediated by sleep at Time 2. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that screen time is negatively related to health outcomes, and that displaced sleep is one of the mediating mechanisms underlying these relations.

AB  - The direction of the correlation between Internet use and psychological well-being is debatable. The displacement hypothesis indicates the correlation is negative, as Internet use for communication replaces face-to face-interaction. Conversely, the augmentation hypothesis suggests that the correlation is positive because Internet use for communication complements existing social interaction. While previous empirical findings about the relationship between Internet use and psychological well-being have been diverse, two previous meta-analyses and the present meta-analysis about the use of social networking sites and psychological well-being supported neither position, and found no relationship between Internet use and psychological well-being. Investigation of causal predominance between Internet use and psychological well-being, increased attention to measurement problems of social networking site use and older adults, and consideration of effects of indicators and moderators should be addressed in future research.

AB  - Each new Information Technology (IT) takes time away from other daily activities. Three highly-publicized early studies of the initial impact of Information Technology indicated it was having negative effects on both social life and mass media use. However, a number of national surveys since then-from the Pew Center, the General Social Survey (GSS), the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA), and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS)-have not replicated these results. Indeed, they find support for Internet and other IT use sometimes being associated with increased social life and media use (especially reading). Moreover, this finding continues to hold after education, income, age and other predictors of social life and mass media use are controlled.

AU  - Espinosa, Pablo

T2  - Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology
AB  - The present study examines the mediating effect of self-transcendence and a self-oriented perspective on the relationship between general video game playing and aggressive antisocial behaviour in a sample of 659 Spanish teenagers of both sexes aged 12 to 18 years (mean age = 15.31 years). Results show that there is a direct effect of the amount of video game playing on aggression, even when violent content is controlled for. Self-transcendence and a self-oriented perspective mediate this effect on aggression. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the effects of media on behaviour are related to the socialisation pattern and role-taking opportunities they offer, and not only due to the mere exposure to violent media. Consistent with the time displacement hypothesis, an interpretation of our results may be that the relationship between video game playing and antisocial behaviour comes from a deficit of social interaction and role-taking opportunities. Not being able to adopt the perspective of others may result in a limited ability to predict the consequences of behaviour and understand the needs, desires, and intentions of others. This social perspective deficit may increase the chances of behaving antisocially through different processes. For instance, an individual may use aggressive behavioural patterns in the absence of a more elaborate behavioural repertoire, or the failure in predicting the effects of an aggressive behaviour may reduce the perception of its consequences.

AU  - Taipale, Sakari
T2  - European Journal of Communication
AB  - This article explores how the time spent on the Internet is associated with printed and online newspaper reading. The direct and moderating effects of gender are especially investigated. The survey data (N = 612) collected from Finland in 2011 are analysed by using hierarchical regression modelling. The results of the study show that Internet use has a displacement effect on printed newspaper reading but only among male respondents. In contrast, results show that more women spend time on the Internet the more frequently they also read printed newspapers. This finding is in line with the so-called efficacy hypothesis. No similar moderating effect of gender was found when exploring online newspaper reading. However, it was noted that men read more online newspapers than women. Lastly, the results of this study call for further investigations on other interaction effects, which have capacity to clarify how one medium can substitute and displace the other.

AB  - This study investigated whether (and how) online video platforms displace television with respect to time investment and viewership. To that end, this study employed mail surveys of a random sample of Internet users throughout the United States. This study revealed that the existence of the time displacement effect depends on (1) what type of online video venues consumers use; (2) how much video content overlaps between online video platforms and television in general; and (3) what type of video content consumers watch online. Specifically, the current study found that the time spent using the Internet to watch user-generated videos and on video-sharing sites reduced the time spent watching television as a consequence.

T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - Decline in the size and diversity of American's core networks has been tied to the displacement of face-to-face interaction and to lower societal well-being. Comparing core networks in the United States, Norway, and Ukraine, we reject the conclusions that frequent in-person contact predicts individual well-being and that large/diverse networks predict broader societal well-being. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) and societies with lower levels of overall prosperity have higher rates of in-person contact. Internet use is associated with higher in-person contact for the socioeconomically advantaged but lower rates of in-person contact for the disadvantaged. In-person and ICT-based contact is generally associated with maintaining a larger network, but in societies of lower well-being frequent interaction impedes the ability to maintain a large network. In contrast to the positive relationship between individual SES and network size, societal prosperity has a negative relationship to network size. Findings are discussed in relation to social support, democratic engagement, and the digital divide. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Technological devices have become more affordable, multifunctional, and portable over recent years. Not only have the number of devices increased in families' households, but also increasingly more evidence documents that children and adolescents keep these devices in their bedrooms. On a related note, the percentage of youth who use technology before bed is remarkably high, and emerging evidence shows technology is now being used during the night. This chapter reviews the effects of various technological devices (TVs, computers/internet, video games, cell phones, music players) on the sleep of children and adolescents. Possible mechanisms explaining these effects (including displacing bedtime, arousal, light and electromagnetic transmission, and nighttime sleep disruption) : are discussed, as well as potential modifying factors of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and parental involvement. Directions for future research and recommendations for families and health professionals are provided in order to continue to improve the sleep hygiene of our youth.

AB  - Adolescents increasingly use electronic media as a night-time activity, amid concerns about the potential negative impact on sleep and daytime functioning. The present study examined electronic media use and pathological media use in relation to sleep activity in a normative sample of Australian adolescents. A total of 1,287 high school students aged 12-18 years (50 % female) were recruited from seven secondary schools in South Australia. Adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing electronic media use, pathological media use, and sleep factors. Adolescents reported non-optimal sleep duration on weekday (71 %) and weekend nights (53 %). One in five adolescents reported nightly bedtime delay as a consequence of electronic media use. Adolescent pathological media users reported significantly more sleep problems than their non-pathological peers. These data contribute to current knowledge of how electronic media use may negatively affect adolescent sleep patterns, particularly in regard to sleep displacement and sleep-onset latency effects. Further research is needed in light of the increasing accessibility and uptake of portable electronic media devices, as well as the growing use of media as a sleeping aid, among young people.

AB  - This study focused on channel complementarity among various interpersonal communication channels (face-to-face, telephone, e-mail, text messaging, and Facebook). We looked at daily channel use among 136 participants and demonstrated complementary channel use among most combinations of channels, excluding face-to-face. We also extended channel complementarity theory by examining social competence as a moderator of channel complementarity. Results indicated that telephone and text messaging exhibited complementarity at high but not low levels of social competence, whereas e-mail and text messaging exhibited complementarity at low but not high levels of social competence. Face-to-face communication and Facebook exhibited a displacement relationship at high but not low levels of social competence. Implications for channel complementarity theory and the role of individual characteristics are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - The video game debate: Unravelling the physical, social, and psychological effects of digital games.
AB  - This chapter will examine the theoretical and empirical relationships between online video game involvement and social outcomes. However, prior to this, a brief overview of online games will be presented, focusing on how their unique integration of play within a social space has created a distinct social environment that converges and diverges from other Internet-based social spaces. Following this, an overview of two predominant theoretical viewpoints that attempt to explain how and why online video game play may be associated with poorer social outcomes will be discussed. While these hypotheses differ in their proposed origin of the social impact of online games they both argue that there is an inverse relationship between online video game play and social outcomes among users of the medium. A proposal for a Cycle Model of Use, which integrates the tenets of the Social Displacement and Social Compensation hypotheses, is also briefly discussed. The chapter will conclude with an examination of the empirical work that has assessed the impact of online video game involvement on players' "social currency" and "social ability".

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 132(2) of Social Indicators Research (see record 2017-23984-001). In the original article, the order of authors was interchanged. The correct order of authors is Peng Nie, Galit Nimrod, and Alfonso Sousa-Poza.] Using data from the 2010 China Family Panel Studies, we analyze the association between Internet use and various measures of subjective well-being (SWB) in a sample of 16- to 60-year-old Chinese. Our analysis shows that although intensive Internet use is significantly associated with lower levels of SWB, we hardly observe any associations when the focus is on participation in specific online activities. Nevertheless, SWB depends on the reasons for using the Internet and the extent to which individuals feel that their Internet use is displacing other activities. Our results suggest that, contrary to previous findings, differences in beneficial outcomes (the third level digital divide) do not necessarily arise from individuals' actual Internet use (the second level digital divide) but rather may result from their subjective perceptions of such usage. Our findings also point to a possible cultural factor that puts Chinese Internet users at psychological risk. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - Internet connectivity has changed the way video games are played by allowing individuals to connect worldwide in shared gaming spaces. These highly social environments allow players to connect, interact with, and learn from each other. However, there is a growing concern that these social environments also have the potential to displace real-world connections and interactions, contributing to a variety of losses in 'offline' sociability. The current study aims to elucidate what users may be gaining or losing (socially) as a result of continued participation in online video game environments, and what potentially underlies these social changes, by examining the associations between social skills and online video game involvement through the perspective of attachment theory. The results challenge the assumption that online video game play is inexorably associated with negative social consequences for the player and indicates the potential for online gaming spaces to serve critical attachment functions by providing a social outlet that promotes a sense of closeness, belonging, and security that satisfies attachment needs for those high in attachment avoidance.

AB  - Using a time-diary, the authors asked 935 undergraduate college students to report on their multitasking habits while engaged in four main activities: reading for fun, watching TV, reading for school purposes, and using the Internet. The authors examined student data to find out (a) whether their multi-tasking habits vary significantly by college classification and (b) whether they felt the time spent multitasking in one activity interfered with or displaced time spent on other activities. It was found that first year college freshmen multitasked significantly more than upper class students. However, students' perceptions relative to whether they felt the time spent multitasking in one activity interfered with or displaced time spent on other activities did not significantly differ by college classification. These findings have important implications for understanding the multitasking habits among college students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Texting's consequences for romantic relationships: A cross-lagged analysis highlights its risks.
AU  - Halpern, Daniel

T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - Advancing a theoretical model to explain the negative effects of texting on romantic relationships, we suggest that constant texting leads partners to attend to their cell phones instead of communicating with their significant other (Pphubbing), reducing through two different processes the perceived quality of a romantic relationship. These processes are: (1) conflicts erupting between couples due to texting behavior; and (2) lack of intimacy, stemming from texting activities that displace focus on the romantic partner. To test the model we conducted a two-wave, representative panel survey, separated by one year. A cross-lagged analysis of the two-wave panel demonstrates that frequency of texting leads to lower levels of perceived quality in relationships. This relationship militates against the argument that individuals in unhappy relationships turn to the phone to avoid being together with the partner. Additionally, results support the proposed model suggesting that both mediators -lack of intimacy and conflicts- have negative effects on perceived relationship quality over time.

AU  - Nimrod, Galit
T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - Relying on Jensen and Helles' model for studying the Internet as a cultural forum, this study aimed to explore the extent to which traditional media are displaced by innovative communication practices within the older audience of new media. The study was based on a cross-European survey of 1039 Internet users aged 60 years and up. Results indicated that older Internet users are significantly more inclined to use traditional mass media than new social media and prefer synchronous to asynchronous mass media. This audience, however, is not homogeneous, as four subsegments were identified. These groups differed in their media repertoires, sociocultural background and leisure preferences. The findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices, with only a minority making intense use of new practices. With very few cross-national differences, this tendency appears to be universal, suggesting overall media use traditionalism and a second-level digital divide among the older audience.

T2  - Sleep disorders in children.
AB  - Young people have an affinity for technological devices. Several reviews of more than 70 studies over the past 15 years have shown consistent links between young people's use of technology and sleep. This has led the scientific and general communities to deduce that using technology before bed worsens sleep. However, the majority of studies performed have been correlational in nature, making causal inferences difficult. This chapter focuses on two important questions of "how" and "how much" technology use affects sleep. The former question details primarily experimental studies that have tested potential mechanisms, including technology use inducing physiological arousal, displacing bedtime, or screenlight disturbing sleep and circadian rhythms. While the latter question appears straightforward, new meta-analytic results suggest it is not. Furthermore, new studies are identifying important moderators for the link between technology use and sleep. Finally, we consider the reverse relationship-the possibility of technology use increasing in response to difficulty sleeping. Our chapter concludes with a research agenda that does not necessarily point the finger at technology use as the reason why so many young people are sleeping too late and too little.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Declines in exposure to nature may deprive young people of experiences that are positive for their mental health. One factor that may interfere with connections to nature is use of electronic screen technologies. The objectives of this study are to (1) document variations in the perceived importance of connections to nature nationally among adolescents; (2) explore relationships between these connections and the use of electronic screens, both epidemiologically and qualitatively; and (3) integrate core findings from both strands in order to provide evidence-based recommendations for health promotion. METHOD(S): The study involved a mixed methods design. Strand 1 involved a qualitative study of 74 Canadians (ages 10-18, years 2016-2018) with data collected through focus groups and interviews. Strand 2 involved a cross-sectional observational analysis of a national survey of 23,920 Canadians (ages 11-15, years 2013-2014). Findings from both strands were integrated through an established protocol. RESULT(S): Increased use of electronic screen technology was consistently associated with lower perceived importance of connections to nature. Barriers to connecting to nature included choices that young people are making, the addictive properties of technology, and beliefs that being indoors is more comfortable and safer than being outdoors. When young people disconnected, their appreciation of being outdoors increased. INTERPRETATION: This novel study showed, quantitatively, that the time young people spend with electronic screens displaces time that they spend engaging in outdoor activities. Deeper reasons why such associations occur emerged in the qualitative strand. Temporary disconnection from screens may lead to renewed opportunities for outdoor exposures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative impacts of parents' smartphone use on the parent-child relationship. A scoping literature review indicated inconsistent effects, arguably attributable to different conceptualizations of parent phone use and conflation of phone use with technological interference. METHOD(S): Based on a sample of n = 3, 659 parents collected in partnership with a national public broadcaster, we conducted a multiverse analysis. We explored 84 different analytic choices to address whether associations were weak versus robust, and provide clearer direction for measurement, theory, and practice. Effects were assessed in relation to p values, effect sizes, and AIC; we further conducted a meta-analytic sensitivity check. RESULT(S): Direct associations between smartphone use and parenting were relatively weak and mixed. Instead, the relation between use and parenting depended on level of technological interference. This pattern was particularly robust for family displacement. At low levels of displacing time with family using technology, more smartphone use was associated with better (not worse) parenting. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate fragility in findings of risks for parental smartphone use on parenting; there were few concerns in this regard. Rather, at low levels of technological interference, more phone use was associated with higher parenting quality. Scholars should avoid generalized narratives of family risk and seek to uncover real effects of smartphone use on family outcomes across diverse households and contexts.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To validate the Social Media Disorder scale in Nigerian adolescents by determining its unidimensional structure, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and criterion validity. Method(s): A total of 516 and 1213 pre-university students in two universities were randomly recruited and assessed using the 9-item Social Media Scale and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (in the second survey only). Result(s): 46.3% and 56.3% of respondents in the first and second surveys met the criteria for social media disorder, respectively. Factor loading of items on the latent factor (addiction) was moderate. The model yielded a fairly acceptable fit in both samples. The averaged measure for intra-class correlation was acceptable (0.612). The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was good (0.713 for sample 1 and 0.724 for sample 2). The test-retest reliability among the 113 respondents was good (r=0.696, p<0.001). The item-total correlations were all significant. Sensitivity of each item ranged from 67.7% (tolerance) to 91.3% (escape); specificity of each item ranged from 41.2% (escape) to 87.6% (displacement). For criterion validity, the total Social Media Disorder scale score correlated with General Health Questionnaire items that assess self-esteem, depression, and mood, as well as the total score. Conclusion(s): The 9-item Social Media Disorder scale is acceptable for screening social media disorder in pre-university students in Nigeria. The high prevalence of social media disorder should be of concern to counsellors, teachers, and mental health practitioners. Strategies for public health education on social media use are needed in Nigeria.Copyright © 2020 Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists.

AB  - Clinicians, teachers, and parents alike have long lamented screen time and its developmental and psychological implications, particularly as access to digital devices, games, and online platforms has become ubiquitous. In 2018, 95% of US teens reported having access to a smartphone, and 45% reported being online "almost constantly."1 Parental and expert concerns include displacement of important activities such as sleep and exercise, Internet or video game addiction, negative social experiences such as cyberbullying, and worry that excessive use may cause or worsen mental health symptoms such as depression.2 3 Research on the subject is challenging, as associations between device use and psychological functioning are likely multifactorial and nonlinear and therefore difficult to elucidate from small samples or samples that are lacking in rich covariate data. In addition, the rapid pace of technological change makes studying and reporting on these phenomena challenging as studies may be out of date before they are even published.Copyright © 2020

TI  - Increases in depression, self-harm, and suicide among U.S. adolescents after 2012 and links to technology use: Possible mechanisms
AU  - Twenge J.M.
T2  - Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice
AB  - Objective: Increases in depression among adolescents have been concurrent with increases in digital media use. In this article, recent trends in mental health among U.S. adolescents and young adults are discussed and theories about their possible connection with concurrent increases in digital media use are presented. Method(s): Large studies of trends in mental health in the 2000s and 2010s are described and possible mechanisms for the trends are discussed based on existing literature. Result(s): After remaining stable during the early 2000s, the prevalence of mental health issues among U.S. adolescents and young adults began to rise in the early 2010s. These trends included sharp increases in depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide, with increases more pronounced among girls and young women. There is a growing consensus that these trends may be connected to the rise in technology use. Increased digital media and smartphone use may influence mental health via several mechanisms, including displace-ment of time spent in in-person social interactions, in-dividually and across the generation, as adolescent cultural norms evolve; disruption of in-person social interactions; interference with sleep time and quality; cyberbullying and toxic online environments; and online contagion and information about self-harm. Conclusion(s): U.S. adolescents and young adults are in the midst of a mental health crisis, particularly among girls and young women. The rise of digital media may have played a role in this problem via several mechanisms.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - It's not all about the likes: Social media affordances with nighttime, problematic, and adverse use as predictors of adolescent sleep indicators
AU  - Bergfeld N.S.
AU  - Van den Bulck J.
T2  - Sleep health
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adolescents are the most prominent users of social media, and their exposure to different contents, platforms, and types of use continues to develop. At the same time, sleep deprivation is on the rise, which may contribute to worsened health. Therefore, this cross-sectional study set out to examine the relationships among several social media affordances, habits of use, and sleep indicators in adolescents. METHOD(S): Students ages 12-18 from a high school on Long Island, New York (N = 410) participated in an anonymous online survey focusing on various aspects of social media use as well as major sleep indicators (sleep displacement, presleep arousal, sleep quality, fatigue). RESULT(S): Snapchat was the only platform to predict a worsened sleep indicator (later bedtime) and it correlated with problematic, adverse, and nighttime use, possibly due to closer relationships among users. More viewing of posts of sports, friends, and family predicted better sleep. Additionally, nighttime social media use, problematic social media use, and adverse social media use each predicted at least one worsened sleep indicator in a hierarchical regression model. CONCLUSION(S): Although some implications were positive, results provided insight into the cons of social media use. This study provides evidence that in order to understand the role of social media in the sleep-wake process, one must look at the specific affordances each platform provides and the different nighttime, problematic, and adverse habits of use that can arise. Documenting the variety of media use behaviors, however, introduces a considerable multiple testing threat to this research area.Copyright © 2021 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Evidence suggests that problematic use of gaming, the internet, and social media among adolescents is on the rise, affecting multiple psycho-emotional domains. However, research providing a comprehensive and triangulated stakeholder perspective of perceived harms is lacking. How are adolescent online harms experienced and conceptualized by students, parents, and teachers? The present study comprised part of a qualitative needs assessment investigation with the use of focus groups and individual interviews among key stakeholder groups assessing perceived impacts with a focus on the negative consequences and perceived harms. The study's sample consisted of students (N = 42, Mage = 13.5, SD = 2.3), parents (N = 9, Mage = 37, SD = 5.6) and teachers (N = 9, Mage = 34, SD = 4.9) from the UK. Data were analysed with thematic analysis. Findings focused primarily on social media use impacts and indicated that processes underlying impacts experienced by adolescents may be conceptualized on a severity continuum. Stakeholder consensus on perceptions of challenges and perceived harms formed the second theme, with impacts further analysed as relating to time displacement, peer judgement, sensory overload and context of the adolescent with functional (performance, task switching, use of multiple devices), cognitive (loss or deterioration of attentional focus, attention deficit), and emotional consequences (stress, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive/checking behaviours). A third theme formed was individual vulnerabilities predisposing poor mental health outcomes. The final theme related to impacts dependent on context and meaning attached. Findings suggest a consideration of a spectrum approach encompassing a broader range of potential psychological challenges and perceived harms beyond safety concerns and addiction in understanding problematic adolescent online experiences. Understanding perceived harms can aid the objective setting of interventions and consideration of mental health literacy in school curricula.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Study Objectives: Evidence for the association between screen time and insufficient sleep is bourgeoning, and recent findings suggest that these associations may be more pronounced in younger compared to older children, and for portable compared to non-portable devices. However, these effects have yet to be investigated within the beginning of life. Importantly, there are no data for the relationship between screen exposure and objectively measured infant sleep. This study examined the moderating role of age for both touchscreens' and television's relationship with sleep, using auto-videosomnography within a big-data sample of infants. Method(s): The sleep of 1074 infants (46% girls) aged 0-18 months was objectively assessed using computer-vision technology in this cross-sectional study. Sleep was additionally reported by parents in an online survey, as was infant exposure to screens. Result(s): Age significantly moderated the relationship between daytime touchscreen exposure and sleep with a distinct pattern for younger infants, in which screen exposure was associated with decreased daytime sleep, but with a proposed compensatory increase in nighttime sleep consolidation. Compared to touchscreens, television exposure was less likely to be associated with sleep metrics, and age moderated this relationship only for daytime and 24-hour sleep duration. Conclusion(s): In young infants, a daytime-nighttime sleep "trade-off"emerged, suggesting that the displacement of daytime sleep by screens may lead to greater accumulation of sleep homeostatic pressure, which in turn facilitates more consolidated nighttime sleep.Copyright © 2020 Sleep Research Society 2020.

AB  - There is growing interest in how exposure to videogames is associated with young children's development. While videogames may displace time from developmentally important activities and have been related to lower reading skills, work in older children and adolescents has suggested that experience with attention-demanding/fast-reaction games positively associates with attention and visuomotor skills. In the current study, we assessed 154 children aged 4-7 years (77 male; mean age 5.38) whose parents reported average daily weekday recreational videogame time, including information about which videogames were played. We investigated associations between videogame exposure and children's sustained, selective, and executive attention skills. We found that videogame time was significantly positively associated only with selective attention. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the directional association between time spent playing recreational videogames and attention skills.Copyright © 2021 Samson et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last decade, social media has permeated most parts of society. Adolescents are particularly active users of social media, and their use has been suggested as a contributing factor to mental health issues in this group. Quantitative studies have found associations between the frequency and/or duration of social media use and more mental health issues. However, most studies are cross-sectional and the identified associations are weak and of questionable practical significance. The aim of this study was to investigate adolescents' lived experiences of using social media, focusing on both negative and positive aspects, using a qualitative approach. Qualitative research enables in-depth explorations of the experiences of individuals, nuance quantitative findings, and offer the perspective of adolescents into policies regarding social media use. METHOD(S): Experiences and perspectives of 27 adolescents from two senior high schools in Norway were gathered using focus group interviews (mean age 16.8, range 15-18). The data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULT(S): According to the participants, social media use catalyse changes to how people communicate and relate to each other (theme 1). Some changes were positive, in terms of facilitating social connectedness, while others were negative, such as people behaving worse than in face-to-face interactions. Further, social media use affected the participants at the individual level (theme 2); positively in terms of a sense of belonging and social support, and negatively in terms of perceived stress, body pressure, and displacing other activities such as sleep and homework. The motivations for using, or not using, social media were multifaceted (theme 3), reflecting the positive and negative aspects of social media in terms of interpersonal and personal consequences. CONCLUSION(S): Social media was described as an important part of the participants' everyday life, with both a positive and negative impact on their mental health and well-being. Considering the compelling nature of social media and adolescents' relatively limited self-regulatory capacities, efforts to modify social media use should avoid relying on self-regulation, while also recognizing the importance of social media as an arena for peer interaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has shown the effectiveness of sedentary behaviour interventions on reducing sedentary time. However, no systematic review has studied where the reduced sedentary time after such interventions is displaced to. OBJECTIVE(S): Our objective was to synthesize the evidence from interventions that have reduced sedentary behaviour and test the displacement of sedentary time into physical activity (light physical activity [LPA], moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA], standing, and stepping). METHOD(S): Two independent researchers performed a systematic search of the EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Meta-analyses were performed to examine the time reallocated from sedentary behaviour to physical activity during working time and the whole day in intervention trials (randomized/non-randomized controlled/non-controlled). RESULT(S): A total of 36 studies met all the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, with 26 studies included in the meta-analysis. Interventions showed a significant overall increase in worksite LPA (effect size [ES] 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.43; P < 0.013) and daily LPA (ES 0.62; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91; P = 0.001). A statistically significant increase in daily MVPA was observed (ES 0.47; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.67; P < 0.001). There was a significant overall increase in worksite standing time (ES 0.76; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95; P < 0.001), daily standing time (ES 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65; P < 0.001), and worksite stepping time (ES 0.12; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.20; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION(S): Effective interventions aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour result in a consistent displacement of sedentary time to LPA and standing time, both at worksites and across the whole day, whereas changes in stepping time or MVPA are dependent on the intervention setting. Strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour should not be limited to worksite settings, and further efforts may be required to promote daily MVPA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exploring parental motives for providing smartphones and tablets to young children is important to better understand ways to optimise healthy use of mobile screens in early childhood. To date, no study has qualitatively examined the factors underpinning parental motives of providing mobile screens to young children, using a theoretically driven approach. METHOD(S): We conducted 45 in-depth, semi structured online interviews with primary caregivers of toddlers and pre-schoolers from diverse family backgrounds who participated in a large online survey in Australia. Themes were generated from the transcribed interviews using template thematic analysis. The coding was completed deductively using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and data-driven induction. RESULT(S): Participants consistently reported a spectrum of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control aspects which drove their decision to provide or not provide a mobile screen device to their child. Five main descriptive themes were generated, guided by the TPB: (1) Convenience, connection, and non-traditional learning experience; (2) Negative behavioural consequences and potential activity displacement through mobile screens; (3) Influences of society and resources; (4) Managing and achieving a balance; (5) External challenges. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, the findings demonstrated that parents experienced cognitive dissonance between their attitudes and behaviour, primarily from perceived behavioural control and subjective norms negating the influence of attitudes on their motives to provide a device. These insights offer important avenues for public health messaging and resources to better involve and support parents in decision-making relating to mobile screens in everyday lives of young children.Copyright © 2022.

T2  - Sleep and Biological Rhythms
AB  - Young adults are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances related to their cell phone use (CPU). The purpose of this study was to test Sleep Displacement and Psychological Arousal theories of CPU-led sleep disruption in relation in a sample of university students. CPU for unstructured leisure activities before sleep (CPU_BeforeBed), as well as CPU for accessing explicit or emotionally charged media content before sleep (CPU_Arousal), were both measured. 525 (75% female) undergraduate students from a large public institution participated in this study during fall 2019. The data were collected using a battery of validated self-report questionnaires. Questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, which was used to measure sleep latency and sleep difficulty, and a contemporary questionnaire developed to measure CPU_BeforeBed and CPU_Arousal. A crude odds ratio analysis was implemented to analyze findings. Sleep Displacement data showed higher odds of sleep latency occurring with CPU_BeforeBed [Exp (B) = 1.091, p < 0.001]. Psychological Arousal data showed higher odds of sleep difficulty occurring with CPU_Arousal [Exp (B) = 1.065, p < 0.001]. CPU_BeforeBed significantly predicted sleep latency [Exp (B) = 1.062, p < 0.01], and CPU_Arousal significantly predicted the sleep difficulty [Exp (B) = 1.069, p < 0.001] of undergraduate students. Young adults who used cell phones before sleep and access emotionally charged content before going to bed were more likely to report trouble sleeping. They took more time to fall asleep at night as their sleep hours were compressed due to CPU. These findings support the Sleep Displacement and Arousal theories of sleep disruption and provide further insight into possible mechanisms for sleep disturbance in young adults.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, adolescents' mental health was largely undermined. A general increment in screen time was reported. However, the long-term effects of the latter on adolescents' mental health are still little explored. Method(s): In the present natural experiment, we investigated these effects using longitudinal data collected before and after the first lockdown in Switzerland. Data come from 674 Swiss adolescents (56.7% females, Mage = 14.45, SDage = 0.50) during Spring 2019 (T1) and Autumn 2020 (T2) as part of the longitudinal MEDIATICINO study. Self-reported mental health measures included somatic symptoms, inattention, anxiety, irritability, anger, sleep problems, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, loneliness, and depression. Measures for screen-media activities included time spent on the Internet, smartphones, social media, video gaming, instant messaging, and television viewing. They were all assessed at T1 and T2. Result(s): Paired-sample t-tests with Bonferroni's correction showed that most mental health problems increased over time with an overall medium effect size (Hedge's g = 0.337). In particular, medium effect sizes were found for anxiety, depression, and inattention; small-to-medium effect sizes were reported for loneliness, sleep problems, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms; and a small effect size was found for somatic symptoms. Screen-media activities increased, with the exception of television viewing and video gaming. The results of the hierarchical regression analyses showed that, controlling for covariates, increased time spent on social media - calculated as the difference between T2 and T1 - was the only screen-media activity significantly associated with worse mental health at T2 (beta = 0.112, p = 0.016). More time spent in structured media activities like television viewing diminished levels of inattention (beta = -0.091, p = 0.021) and anxiety (beta = -0.093, p = 0.014). Among covariates, being female, experiencing two or more life events, having mental health problems at T1, and using screens for homeschooling negatively influenced mental health at T2. Conclusion(s): These results align with literature indicating a small but negative effect of social media time on mental health. Underlying mechanisms are manifold, including increased exposure to COVID-19 news, heightened fear of missing out, social comparison, and time-displaced for activities such as physical activity and green time. However, in line with the structured days hypothesis, getting involved in media-structured activities like television viewing might protect against mental health symptoms.Copyright © 2022 Marciano, Viswanath, Morese and Camerini.

T2  - Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking
AB  - This study addresses the relationship between the social context in which individuals play video games, pathological gaming, and depressive symptoms. A sample of 265 participants recruited through local gaming communities completed an online survey asking questions pertaining to demographics, the most common social context of their gaming, depressive symptoms, and pathological gaming. Participants also responded to the open-ended question "How do you feel gaming has impacted you socially? Why?" Many participants felt gaming helped to expand their social circle, maintain existing relationships, develop social skills, and connect with others during Covid-19 lockdowns. A small minority of participants reported that gaming displaced time they could have spent with friends and family, and sometimes damaged their social skills. Using an Ordinary Least Squares regression framework, quantitative results indicate that those who gamed primarily in-person with friends displayed lower levels of pathological gaming than all other contexts. Those who gamed in-person with friends also displayed lower levels of depressive symptoms, although this was found to be somewhat a function of time spent gaming. These results indicate that perhaps in-person gaming with friends is a protective context for gaming compared with online gaming, or solitary gaming.

AB  - Background: Autistic children and youth spend a significant amount of their time interacting with technology, however, the characterization of use remains sparse. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterise the patterns and purpose of technology use among autistic children compared to non-autistic children, 2) explore the impact of how technology use affects child and family well-being, and 3) examine parents' attitudes towards childrens' technology use. Method(s): A 44-question anonymous parent-report survey developed in consultation with families of autistic children and clinicians was available online for 22 months, from April 2018 through February 2020. Parents and caregivers of children 19-years-old and younger were eligible to complete the survey. Result(s): 611 survey responses were collected (autism group = 407; community group = 204). The autism group exhibited greater technology use across all time points of interest, with tablets being the most frequently used device type. The autism group was also more likely to use technology for therapeutic and recreational activities. The autism group experienced more positive impacts on quality of life and benefited more in areas of social, motor, language, and emotion regulation skills from technology use than the community group. Parents of older children, males, and those in the autism group were more likely to report displaced socialising with technology use. Positive attitudes were more likely to be reported by parents of autistic children and younger children, whereas negative feelings were more likely to be reported by parents of older and male children. Limitation(s): The study findings must be interpreted within the context of several limitations, including the size and representativeness of the sample, potential for bias from parent-report, and limitations in the survey design (closed-ended questions). Conclusion(s): Autistic children exhibited more technology use than non-autistic children. Parental perceptions of impact were highly mixed, and included potential benefits for recreation and supports. Implications for technology developers and clinical practitioners are discussed.Copyright © 2023 The Authors

T2  - Child development
AB  - Using psychological network analysis, this study explored the heterogeneity of the network structure between extracurricular time-use and delinquency using a nationally representative longitudinal survey of at-school students in China (N = 10,279, 47.3% female, average age 13.6, 91.2% Han ethnicity). The results are threefold: First, time stimulation of activities occurs on weekdays, while time displacement and stimulation occur on weekends. Second, delinquent behaviors are positively correlated, forming a problem behavior syndrome. Smoking or drinking is the central delinquent behavior. Third, negative consequences of specific time-use behaviors are more likely to occur on weekends than on weekdays, and time-use behavior may function differently on weekdays versus weekends. Among them, going to coffeenets or game-centers serves as the bridge with the highest potential of triggering delinquency.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

T2  - Journal of physical activity & health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although 24-hour movement behaviors are known to be interconnected, limited knowledge exists about whether change in one behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, increased screen time) was associated with change in another (eg, reduced physical activity or sleep). This review estimates mediational associations between changes in children's physical activity, screen time, and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD(S): We included studies published between January 1, 2020 and June 27, 2022, in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases. Summary data were extracted from included studies and analyzed with random-effects meta-regression. RESULT(S): This review included 26 studies representing 18,959 children across 18 mid-high-income countries (53% male; mean age, 11.5 [2.9] y). There was very good evidence of decreased total daily physical activity (factor change, 0.62; 90% CI, 0.47-0.81) and strong evidence of increased screen time (1.56; 90% CI, 1.38-1.77). There was very good evidence of decreased moderate to vigorous physical activity (0.75; 90% CI, 0.62-0.90) and weak evidence of increased sleep (1.02; 90% CI, 1.00-1.04). Mediational analysis revealed strong evidence that most of the reduction in total daily physical activity from before, to during, the pandemic was associated with increased screen time (0.53; 90% CI, 0.42-0.67). We observed no further mediational associations. CONCLUSION(S): Increased reliance on and use of screen-based devices during the COVID-19 pandemic can be linked with reduced child and adolescent physical activity. This finding links COVID-related restrictions to potential displacement effects within child and adolescent 24-hour movement behavior.

AB  - Studies suggest that hourly digital screen time increases adolescents' depressive symptoms and emotional regulation difficulties. However, causal mechanisms behind such associations remain unclear. We hypothesized that problem-focused and/or emotion-focused engagement coping moderates and possibly mediates this association over time. Questionnaire data were collected in three waves from a representative sample of Swedish adolescents (0, 3 and 12 months; n = 4793; 51% boys; 99% aged 13-15). Generalized Estimating Equations estimated the main effects and moderation effects, and structural regression estimated the mediation pathways. The results showed that problem-focused coping had a main effect on future depression (b = 0.030; p < 0.001) and moderated the effect of screen time (b = 0.009; p < 0.01). The effect size of this moderation was maximum 3.4 BDI-II scores. The mediation results corroborated the finding that future depression was only indirectly correlated with baseline screen time, conditional upon intermittent problem-coping interference (C'-path: Std. beta = 0.001; p = 0.018). The data did not support direct effects, emotion-focused coping effects, or reversed causality. We conclude that hourly screen time can increase depressive symptoms in adolescent populations through interferences with problem-focused coping and other emotional regulation behaviors. Preventive programs could target coping interferences to improve public health. We discuss psychological models of why screen time may interfere with coping, including displacement effects and echo chamber phenomena.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose of Review: This paper will review the impacts of the COVID pandemic on adolescents. This pandemic has had profound effects on the medical, mental, and social domains of adolescents throughout the world. Recent Findings: Worldwide, over ten million children and adolescents lost a parent or caregiver to the disease. Remote learning, lockdowns, and other restrictions led to increases in adolescents with obesity. Rising numbers of adolescents with depression, eating disorders, or suicidal thinking flooded the emergency rooms of hospitals. Learning suffered especially in resource-limited schools. Increased social media usage led to further worries and fears of the pandemic as well as problematic internet use while displacing adolescents' physical activities and sleep. Racism and food insecurity appeared to increase. One technological breakthrough due to the pandemic was telemedicine that allowed clinicians to establish and continue care for most adolescents. Summary: This review examines the profound effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the lives of adolescents throughout the world. In particular, this paper identifies the impacts on adolescents in the medical, mental, and social realms of their lives.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - Journal of interpersonal violence
AB  - Previous research documents relationships between unstructured socializing activities and in-person victimization in adolescents. In parallel, there is a body of research which has linked virtual socialization activities (i.e., social networking, texting, video chatting, phone usage) with both online and in-person victimization. The majority of research in this area, however, has assumed the relationship between time spent engaging in virtual socializing and victimization is linear. Yet, there are several reasons to anticipate that while virtual socializing may initially increase the risks for in-person victimization, after adolescents begin spending a significant portion of their free time socializing virtually this may function to displace time they would have otherwise spent engaging in unstructured socializing in-person. As a result, very high levels of engagement in virtual socializing may actually lower the risks for in-person victimization. This study addresses this gap in the literature by utilizing negative binomial regression and logistic regression to test for nonlinearity in the relationship between virtual socializing and three forms of in-person victimization (i.e., violent, property, and in-person bullying) using data from the 8th and 10th grade 2018 cohort of Monitoring the Future. In addition, this study tests for nonlinearity in the relationship between virtual socializing and one form of online victimization (i.e., cyberbullying). Our findings reveal that virtual socializing is associated with all four forms of victimization. In addition, tests for nonlinearity revealed that virtual socializing exhibits a nonlinear relationship with in-person property victimization and cyberbullying victimization. Additional analyses revealed differential relationships between individual virtual socializing activities and the risks for property victimization. On the other hand, three out of the four forms of virtual socializing activities were found to exhibit nonlinear relationships with the likelihood of cyberbullying victimization. Overall, these findings imply that virtual socializing activities appear to exhibit nonlinear relationships with several forms of victimization.

T2  - Acta Biomedica
AB  - Background and aim of the work: The escalating phenomenon of online gaming among adolescents has emerged as a notable concern, exerting profound effects on their individual lives and interpersonal dynamics. The adolescents' struggle to effectively manage their emotional responses has been implicated in a spectrum of school-related disturbances. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of gaming disorder among adolescent in Indonesia. Research design and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents in the city of Banda Aceh in Indonesia. A multistage random sampling method was used to select 616 students from six junior high schools across the city. The presence of Internet gaming disorder was accessed using the Indonesian version Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-Short Form (IGDS9-SF). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Result(s): It was found that 30.8% of the adolescents had already experienced a gaming disorder. The mean score was 18.25 (SD = 6.773) and the subscales including preoccupation (Mean 2.43, SD=1.025), withdrawal (Mean. 1.88. SD=1.251), tolerance (Mean.2.42. SD=1.331), persistent (Mean.2.20. SD=1.323), displacement (Mean.1.74. SD=1.200), problem (Mean.1.83.SD=1.170), deception (Mean.1.55. SD=1.016), escape (Mean.2.68. SD=1.437), and conflict (Mean.1.52. SD=1.031). Conclusion(s): The prevalence of gaming disorder was relatively high among Indonesia adolescents. The high prevalence rate and high average scores indicate the need for stronger prevention and intervention programs to overcome gaming disorder. Comprehensive attention, particularly in schools, is necessary, along with preventive measures to reduce gaming disorder. (www.actabiomedica.it).Copyright © 2024, Mattioli 1885. All rights reserved.

The qualities of surrounding in which a child lives, grows up and learns are key for attaining their milestones. Increased availability of screen-based media in families leads to excessive screen time among young children, resulting in high chances of displacing parent-child interaction which is fundamental in a thriving child's process of learning and development. Numerous publications have investigated the potential health impacts of early exposure and excessive usage of screen-based media among children, with literature suggesting links between excessive screen time and behavioural difficulties, developmental delay and increased risk of obesity, among other issues. Existing guidelines from international bodies call for limiting screen time to an hour per day for children aged two to five years old and urge that children below the age of two should not be exposed to any screen time. To spark awareness among parents and caregivers concerning the potential health impacts of screen-based media usage among young children, child media habits are recommended to be incorporated as part of toddlers' developmental assessment in health clinics. A guideline for mindful usage of screen-based media focusing on children below the age of five tailored to a Malaysian context ought to be developed based on current evidence from research, theory and practice. A collaborative effort between concerned agencies is essential to ensuring a developmentally stimulating environment in which young children may grow up.

AB  - Social media are popular among adolescents worldwide, including the global South. The way adolescents use social media is influenced by their own perception of social media but also by how their parents use and perceive social media. This study aims to understand how Indonesian young adolescents (12-15 years old) and parents of adolescents use and perceive social media. For this purpose, we conducted eight focus group discussions and eight semi-structured interviews with 30 Indonesian adolescents and 15 Indonesian parents. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data reveals that both adolescents and parents use social media for social, practical, and pleasure activities. Most adolescents mention that they consider themselves skilled in using social media, while parents consider themselves less skilled. Both adolescents and parents mention that social media offer benefits for adolescents, including emotional, social, and practical benefits. However, adolescents and parents also mention the risks of social media use for adolescents, including social, emotional, and informational risks, as well as the displacement of more meaningful activities. As such, both adolescents and parents do not perceive social media as inherently good or bad but rather as a novel medium that offers benefits for adolescents but also involves several risks to be considered by parents and other relevant stakeholders. This study adds to our understanding of social media use in the global South and offers a theoretical basis for future studies on the impact of adolescents' social media usage on wellbeing in an Indonesian context. However, future research is necessary to depict possible differences in social media use between Indonesia and other countries in the global South.

TI  - Uncovering the Missing Pieces: Predictors of Nonresponse in a Mobile Experience Sampling Study on Media Effects Among Youth.
AU  - Reinhardt, Anne

T2  - Social science computer review
AB  - Mobile Experience Sampling (MES) is a promising tool for understanding youth digital media use and its effects. Unfortunately, the method suffers from high levels of missing data. Depending on whether the data is randomly or non-randomly missing, it can have severe effects on the validity of findings. For this reason, we investigated predictors of non-response in an MES study on displacement effects of digital media use on adolescents' well-being and academic performance (N = 347). Multilevel binary logistic regression identified significant influencing factors of response odds, such as afternoon beeps and being outside. Importantly, adolescents with poorer school grades were more likely to miss beeps. Because this missingness was related to the outcome variable, modern missing data methods such as multiple imputation should be applied before analyzing the data. Understanding the reasons for non-response can be seen as the first step to preventing, minimizing, and handling missing data in MES studies, ultimately ensuring that the collected data is fully utilized to draw accurate conclusions.

AB  - Social media interferes with pediatric sleep health with downstream consequences for mental health and other developmental outcomes. Based on the literature on screen use and sleep, social media likely affects sleep through the following proposed mechanisms: activity displacement, content-related arousal, alerting effects of light, and disruptions from noises and vibrations. Future research on this topic should improve measurement of both social media use and sleep health. Scalable, sustainable, and effective interventions should be developed and evaluated. We offer clinical recommendations for reducing the negative effects of social media on pediatric sleep health. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are growing concerns that increased screen device usage may have a detrimental impact on classroom behaviour and attentional focus. The consequences of screen use on child cognitive functioning have been relatively under-studied, and results remain largely inconsistent. Screen usage may displace the time usually spent asleep. The aim of this study was to examine associations between screen use, behavioural inattention and sustained attention control, and the potential modifying role of sleep. The relations between screen use, behavioural inattention, sustained attention and sleep were investigated in 162 6- to 8-year-old children, using parent-reported daily screen use, the SWAN ADHD behaviour rating scale, The sustained attention to response task and the children's sleep habits questionnaire. Tablet use was associated with better sustained attention performance but was not associated with classroom behavioural inattention. Shorter sleep duration was associated with poorer behavioural inattention and sustained attention. Sleep quality and duration did not act as mediators between screen usage and behavioural inattention nor sustained attention control. These findings suggest that careful management of the amount of time spent on electronic screen devices could have a beneficial cognitive impact on young children. The results also highlight the critical role of sleep in enhancing both behavioural attention and sustained attention, which are essential for supporting cognitive development and learning.

AB  - Medical professionals should be mindful of social media's impact on attention, especially for youth who already has limited ability to focus due to neurocognitive difficulties or emotional disorders. Digital distractions often interfere with academic performance. Social media interactions displace other means for youth to learn about the world and contribute to the spread of misinformation. Attentional literacy is a method of combating digital distraction and misinformation by promoting an intentional application of focus. Addressing information overload and misinformation requires individuals and institutions to actively manage attentional resources and employ thoughtful content analysis.

AU  - Stewart, AM
AU  - Wright, NA
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPORTS ECONOMICS
AB  - This article examines the effect of televised international sporting events (e.g., FIFA World Cup or Summer Olympics) on crime in Jamaica. We use a fixed effects model that compares, within each police division, the level of crime that occurs during these international sporting events to the rate of crime on similar days when these events are not occurring. We found that on days when the FIFA World Cup matches are held, there is a reduction in the number of murders (23.3%), shootings (20%), break-ins (19.4%), and robberies (11.7%), relative to the average number of each incident. We found no evidence of crime displacement, as these crimes also reduced during nonmatch periods during the FIFA World Cup. On the other hand, our results suggest that the international events that are less popular in Jamaica (the World Athletics Championship, the Summer Olympics, and the Winter Olympics) had a minimal impact on crime.

AB  - We empirically study the effects of broadband internet diffusion on local election outcomes and on local government policies using rich data from the U.K. Our analysis shows that the internet has displaced other media with greater news content (i.e. radio and newspapers), thereby decreasing voter turnout, most notably among less-educated and younger individuals. In turn, we find suggestive evidence that local government expenditures and taxes are lower in areas with greater broadband diffusion, particularly expenditures targeted at less-educated voters. Our findings are consistent with the idea that voters' information plays a key role in determining electoral participation, government policies, and government size.

AU  - Machill, M
AU  - Beiler, M
T2  - JOURNALISM STUDIES
AB  - This article reports how journalists integrate online research procedures into the overall research process, how they assess the Internet and search engines, and how highly developed their competences are in using search engines. Observation of 235 journalists from newspaper, radio, television and online media platforms provide the data base. To this is added a written survey of 601 journalists and the participation of 48 journalists in an experiment. The observation phase revealed that journalists employ computer-aided research tools more frequently but for shorter periods than classical, non-computer-aided research tools. The telephone remains the most important research tool. Search engines, in particular Google, dominate the source-determination process and thereby have a decisive influence on the entire course of journalists' research. The survey showed that a high level of journalistic attention focused on only a few Internet offerings. The surveyed journalists exhibit a pragmatic attitude towards the Internet and search engines as a research tool, even though they are aware of possible problems. The search-engine experiment revealed that journalists only achieved moderate success in their research. The greatest search success was achieved by journalists who entered the search terms in a thought-out manner and combined them logically. Overall, the study shows that computer-aided research supplements but does not displace classical research. Instead, the Internet gains in significance in those tasks which it helps to fulfil more efficiently. However, the increased self-referentiality in journalism and the "Google-ization" of research represent a cause for concern.

We test for the effect of television entertainment on crime by leveraging the randomness inherent in the scheduling of sporting events. We compare Chicago crime reports by the half hour when Chicago's sports teams are playing to reports at the same time, day, and month when the teams are not playing. We conduct the same analysis for the Super Bowl, National Basketball Association Finals, and Major League Baseball World Series. We find consistent decreases in crime during games. Short-term crime displacement is minimal or nonexistent.

AB  - Author summaryWhy was this study done? Watching unhealthy food advertising increases the calories children eat. While greater calorie intake increases the likelihood of a child gaining excess weight, little is known about the impact of advertising on childhood obesity and overweight. Restrictions on television advertising of unhealthy food are actively being considered in the UK to help prevent childhood obesity; the impact of these proposed restrictions is unknown. What did the researchers do and find? We used computer modelling to estimate the health impact of prohibiting the advertising of food and beverages high in fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS) from 05.30 hours to 21.00 hours on television in the UK. Using 2015 data, we estimate that if all HFSS advertising between 05.30 hours and 21.00 hours was withdrawn, children in the UK would see, on average, 1.5 fewer HFSS adverts per day, which would reduce the number of children (aged 5-17 years) with obesity by 4.6% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.4%-9.5%) and with overweight (including obesity) by 3.6% (95% UI 1.1%-7.4%). We estimate that if all HFSS advertising is displaced to after 21.00 hours, rather than being withdrawn, the health benefits would be reduced by around two-thirds. What do these findings mean? Measures that have the potential to reduce exposure to less-healthy food advertising on television, such as restricting HFSS advertising between 05.30 hours and 21.00 hours, could make a meaningful contribution to reducing childhood obesity. The impact of this policy is likely to be reduced if adverts are displaced to after 21.00 hours or to other media. This is a modelling study, and we cannot fully account accurately for all factors that would affect the impact of this policy if it was implemented.Background Restrictions on the advertising of less-healthy foods and beverages is seen as one measure to tackle childhood obesity and is under active consideration by the UK government. Whilst evidence increasingly links this advertising to excess calorie intake, understanding of the potential impact of advertising restrictions on population health is limited. Methods and findings We used a proportional multi-state life table model to estimate the health impact of prohibiting the advertising of food and beverages high in fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS) from 05.30 hours to 21.00 hours (5:30 AM to 9:00 PM) on television in the UK. We used the following data to parameterise the model: children's exposure to HFSS advertising from AC Nielsen and Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (2015); effect of less-healthy food advertising on acute caloric intake in children from a published meta-analysis; population numbers and all-cause mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database for the UK (2015); body mass index distribution from the Health Survey for England (2016); disability weights for estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from the Global Burden of Disease Study; and healthcare costs from NHS England programme budgeting data. The main outcome measures were change in the percentage of the children (aged 5-17 years) with obesity defined using the International Obesity Task Force cut-points, and change in health status (DALYs). Monte Carlo analyses was used to estimate 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We estimate that if all HFSS advertising between 05.30 hours and 21.00 hours was withdrawn, UK children (n= 13,729,000), would see on average 1.5 fewer HFSS adverts per day and decrease caloric intake by 9.1 kcal (95% UI 0.5-17.7 kcal), which would reduce the number of children (aged 5-17 years) with obesity by 4.6% (95% UI 1.4%-9.5%) and with overweight (including obesity) by 3.6% (95% UI 1.1%-7.4%) This is equivalent to 40,000 (95% UI 12,000-81,000) fewer UK children with obesity, and 120,000 (95% UI 34,000-240,000) fewer with overweight. For children alive in 2015 (n =13,729,000), this would avert 240,000 (95% UI 65,000-530,000) DALYs across their lifetime (i.e., followed from 2015 through to death), and result in a health-related net monetary benefit of 7.4 pound billion (95% UI 2.0 pound billion-16 pound billion) to society. Under a scenario where all HFSS advertising is displaced to after 21.00 hours, rather than withdrawn, we estimate that the benefits would be reduced by around two-thirds. This is a modelling study and subject to uncertainty; we cannot fully and accurately account for all of the factors that would affect the impact of this policy if implemented. Whilst randomised trials show that children exposed to less-healthy food advertising consume more calories, there is uncertainty about the nature of the dose-response relationship between HFSS advertising and calorie intake. Conclusions Our results show that HFSS television advertising restrictions between 05.30 hours and 21.00 hours in the UK could make a meaningful contribution to reducing childhood obesity. We estimate that the impact on childhood obesity of this policy may be reduced by around two-thirds if adverts are displaced to after 21.00 hours rather than being withdrawn.

TI  - Displacement from piracy in the American comic book market
AU  - Hardy, W
T2  - INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB  - Much like the music and movies industries before, the comic book industry has entered the digital markets and faces the unfair competition of unauthorized sources. I conduct a survey of comic book readers to analyse the relationship between the pirate channels and the sales of comic books from the top American publishers. My data allows me to construct a time panel of comics readers and calculate the substitution rate between the paid and unpaid channels of comics acquisition. I find that piracy is negatively related to comics sales though mainly those of limited series. Moreover, for digital comics the relationship is observable only for a smaller group of readers with high valuations of digital formats. I also show that the digital comics - both paid and unpaid - are typically considered as inferior by the readers. With the price of digitally released new comics set at the same level as their print versions, this suggests that readers who do not want to pay the full price for print copies are more likely to use pirate sources than to switch to legal digital channels. Still, both paid and unpaid readership is associated with higher interest in other types of comics-based media such as movies or video games. This suggests that comics piracy might carry some indirect positive effects. As this aspect could improve the negotiating position of comic book authors it should be studied further.

TI  - Locating the "Scruff Guy": Theorizing Body and Space in Gay Geosocial Media
AU  - Roth, Y
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - This article offers a critical examination of the smartphone application Scruff, a gay geosocial networking service targeted primarily at bears that boasts a user base of more than five million individuals in more than 180 countries. Using a case study of gay geosocial networking, the article argues for a theoretical reworking of the relationships among embodiment, space, and digital media. Geosocial services such as Scruff, by virtue of their emphasis on bodies and locations that can be accessed offline, complicate notions that online interactions are displaced, disembodied, and ethereal. By layering a virtual, but still spatialized network of users atop existing physical locations, Scruff straddles the online-offline divide and indicates how bodies, places, and identities are discursively constructed through the interplay of virtual and physical experience.

AB  - Using 50 countries' media-market panel data from 2012 to 2016, this study examines changes in the global media industry caused by the development of the Internet and assesses the influence of cultural factors on these changes. In the light of niche theory, an analytical method of measuring the competition among media, this study analyzes gradual changes in the online and offline media markets. By using Hofstede's cultural dimensions as a lens for analyzing cultural factors affecting Internet displacement effects, this study finds that culture is one of the critical factors affecting online vs. offline competition.

AU  - Bae, G

T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB  - Purpose Social media (e.g., e-WOM) and traditional media (e.g., media coverage) serve different roles in a firm's marketing activities and also interact with each other, which in turn affect the market outcome. In addition, how market outcome affects the two types of media in turn has not been examined, which brings the need for a holistic framework. The rare study that examines this relation mostly relies on the volume of media rather than the valence. This study examines the interdependent relation between the volume and valence of social media, the volume of traditional media and TV ratings. Design/methodology/approach Forty-one South Korean TV drama shows from October 2014 to March 2016 were analyzed using the 3SLS estimation to examine the interdependent relation between the variables. Findings First, the volume of traditional media has a negative effect on the volume of social media. Second, ratings negatively affect the valence of social media. Third, the volume of traditional media is found to have a negative effect on ratings. This is explained by the displacement effect. Originality/value This study is one of the very few studies that examine the interdependent relation between various earned media and market outcomes in one framework. In addition, it has originality in that it considers the valence of social media, which is an important dimension in analyzing earned media. Our results show negative effects of news media on TV ratings and e-WOM, which diverge from common intuition.

TI  - How to fight loneliness: The importance of networked friendship quality and self-esteem differs with age
AU  - Bouchillon, BC
T2  - TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - Loneliness has increased dramatically in the United States, with young Americans being the loneliest. They spend more time on the Internet than previous generations, which is argued to have displaced interpersonal contact and connections. This socioemotional isolation can damage self-esteem, so research has begun to consider the potential for networked social living to improve how users feel about themselves, and how they connect with others. The present study contributes to this literature by weighing the influence of networked friendship quality-or developing a sense of closeness with other people when social networking-on trait self-esteem and loneliness. A web survey was conducted in September 2022 and matched to U.S. Census percentages for sex, race, ethnicity, age, and region of residence (N = 1500), followed by a second wave of the survey six weeks later, to create a two-wave panel (N = 752). In both the cross-sectional sample and the panel, networked friendship quality contributed to self-esteem, and gains in self-esteem led to reductions in loneliness. This indirect association was the largest for the youngest users surveyed, who base more of their self-perception on becoming close with other users social networking. This allows networked friendship quality to offer a potent means of addressing loneliness for them, albeit indirectly.

T2  - CURRENT ADDICTION REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of review The effect of pornography on romantic relationships has been long discussed in popular culture and by researchers. The aim of the current review is to discuss the most recent findings probing the potential effect of pornography consumption on relationship and sexual satisfaction for individuals who are in romantic relationships.Recent findings Currently, there has only been one meta-analysis, which shows that pornography consumption and sexual and relationship satisfaction are negatively related for men but not for women (Hum Commun Res. 43(3):315-43, 6). Potential mediators of this link include a preference for pornographic over partnered sexual excitement, the devaluation of intimate sexual communication, decreased partnered sex due to masturbatory displacement, and upward comparisons between one's own sex life and sex in pornography. Potential moderators include frequency of consumption and whether pornography use is alone for masturbation or partnered as a coupled sexual enhancement.Summary Future studies examining previously discussed potential moderators and mediators are needed to replicate findings and provide extension to theory directed toward pornography's effects on romantic relationships. Additional meta-analyses on process and contingency are also needed to further synthesize the research on pornography's effect on partnered sexual activity. Clinical implications are discussed as related to problematic pornography use.

AB  - Although there has been a great deal of research on the impact of television on children's academic achievement in the past five decades the evidence remains still unclear. This article reports on the main results of a longitudinal study conducted at the University of Wuerzburg (Germany). Trying to avoid major problems of previous investigations the study aimed at clarifying some important inconsistencies in this field of research. Although there is some evidence for a causal relationship between television and achievement in language and reading the underlying mechanism of the television effect remains unclear. Results suggest that the three major hypotheses (displacement hypothesis, concentration-deterioration hypothesis, reading-depreciation hypothesis) may not be suited to explain how television affects language and reading abilities. More sophisticated analyses indicated that heavy viewing may be especially disadvantageous in children who have low intellectual abilities or come from families with a high socioeconomic status. The observed negative effects where limited to the consumption of entertainment programs whereas educational programs turned out to exert a slightly positive influence on later language and reading abilities.

AB  - Netflix is commonly referred as an over-the-top (OTT) media, and it takes a role of a video platform changing the market. The purpose of this research is to explain the competition in Korean video platform market, in particular competition between traditional pay TV and OTT. In this study, the theory of the niche is adopted to explain the competitive dynamics in video platform market in Korea. This theory is a unique framework to conceptualize and empirically measure the impact of new media on the old one. It explains and predicts the existence, displacement, and extirpation of players in the ecosystem. To make up for the previous researches, multiple resources such as gratification and time spent using media are measured in this study. The result indicates that the case of the Korean market was significantly different from the case of America, in that competition between traditional pay TV and OTT was not severe.

AB  - The problem of communication has always been in the center of attention of philosophers. Today it became of current interest because the world is changing and becoming very complicated. Human's position in the world is unstable and it is becoming difficult to survive in a total communication. Virtual communication "displaces" real "meeting" I and Thou. Media just complicate existing structures of communication. In this turbulent world the younger generation (Digital Natives) still needs mentors which are able to direct their intuition and energy in creative direction, to create a sphere of dialogue, to cultivate harmonious personalities. Communication is the substance of human existence, but in the discourse of the media features of communication complicated, they take the nature of rhizome, become chaotic. At the same time human can establish harmony with the outside world and him- (or her-) self. But he (or she) can't overcome the effects of the media (the acceleration of information; the simplification of information; the likening of information; the "dissolution" of person) alone. Therefore, finding ways to harmonize communication in the era of networked media becomes the priority. That is why the main result of the study is identifying requirements of communication which can help human to find announced harmony.

AU  - Buser, M

AU  - Ridpath, BD
T2  - SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose In this paper, Fantasy Sports (Hereafter FS) is conceptually classified as a concept of gamification for professional sport leagues. From a sporting perspective, FS is often criticized because such online activities may be at the expense of physical activities. Otherwise, gamification can ultimately lead to economic advantages for sport leagues. To further empirically analyse this supposed juxtaposition, an empirical study is presented. Design/methodology/approach In the empirical study, participation and non-participation in a sport league-related FS league are analysed and the study uses a divided sample (N = 319) for a one-factor Welch-ANOVA. FS effects on sport practice (engaging in doing sport) and usage (engaging with sport) of FS players as well as on gaining and retaining fans are investigated. Findings Results demonstrate that participating in gamified FS experiences increases sport usage while not harming general sport practice. Furthermore, FS participation increases consumption capital as well as sport fans' loyalty and word of mouth (WOM) towards the league brand. Building on the results, league brands should foster gamified FS applications to retain their fan base and acquire new fans. Originality/value The authors' theoretical contribution indicates the importance of FS as a gamified application and essential marketing tool for professional sport leagues. By introducing the terms sport practice and usage, the authors bridge the traditional logic of sport consumption with innovative approaches around engagement in and with sports. The results refute the prejudice that FS leads to less physical activity due to time substitution or displacement.

T2  - JMIR SERIOUS GAMES
AB  - The metaverse is gaining traction in the general population and has become a priority of the technological industry. Defined as persistent virtual worlds that exist in virtual or augmented reality, the metaverse proposes to afford a range of activities of daily life, from socializing and relaxing to gaming, shopping, and working. Because of its scope, its projected popularity, and its immersivity, the metaverse may pose unique opportunities and risks for mental health. In this viewpoint article, we integrate existing evidence on the mental health impacts of video games, social media, and virtual reality to anticipate how the metaverse could influence mental health. We outline 2 categories of mechanisms related to mental health: experiences or behaviors afforded by the metaverse and experiences or behaviors displaced by it. The metaverse may benefit mental health by affording control (over an avatar and its virtual environment), cognitive activation, physical activity, social connections, and a sense of autonomy and competence. However, repetitive rewarding experiences may lead to addiction-like behaviors, and high engagement in virtual worlds may facilitate and perpetuate the avoidance of challenges in the offline environment. Further, time spent in virtual worlds may displace (reduce) other determinants of mental health, such as sleep rhythms and offline social capital. Importantly, individuals will differ in their uses of and psychological responses to the metaverse, resulting in heterogeneous impacts on their mental health. Their technological motivations, developmental stage, sociodemographic context, and prior mental health problems are some of the factors that may modify and frame the positive and negative effects of the metaverse on their mental health. In conclusion, as the metaverse is being scaffolded by the industry and by its users, there is a window of opportunity for researchers, clinicians, and people with lived experience to coproduce knowledge on its possible impacts on mental health and illness, with the hope of influencing policy-making, technological development, and counseling of patients.

T2  - ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW
AB  - Concerns over the perceived negative impacts of computers on social development among children are prevalent but largely uninformed by plausibly causal evidence. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a large-scale randomized control experiment in which more than one thousand children attending grades 6-10 across 15 different schools and 5 school districts in California were randomly given computers to use at home. Children in the treatment group are more likely to report having a social networking site, but also report spending more time communicating with their friends and interacting with their friends in person. There is no evidence that computer ownership displaces participation in after-school activities such as sports teams or clubs or reduces school participation and engagement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and digital and AI literacy with types of Chat GPT use by college students, with subsequent implications for academic self-efficacy and creativity, conditioned by trust. Analyses of a survey of U.S. college students (N = 947) show that SES has a greater association with AI literacy than with general digital literacy. Two dimensions of Chat GPT activities emerge: academic support and displacement. Structural equation modeling reveals that AI literacy is positively associated with both activity dimensions, while digital literacy is unexpectedly a negative contributor. Further, academic support is strongly linked to positive outcomes whereas academic displacement is negatively associated. Attitudinal trust in Chat GPT moderates the overall relationships. Our findings suggest that conventional digital inequality persists and evolves with generative AI, traditional digital literacy becomes insufficient in the age of AI, and trust in this new and opaque digital technology influences these relationships.

AB  - PurposeIn response to growing concerns over the negative consequences of Internet addiction on adolescents' mental health, coupled with conflicting results in this literature stream, this meta-analysis sought to (1) examine the association between Internet addiction and depressive symptoms in adolescents, (2) examine the moderating role of Internet freedom across countries, and (3) examine the mediating role of excessive daytime sleepiness.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 52 studies were analyzed using robust variance estimation and meta-analytic structural equation modeling.FindingsThere was a significant and moderate association between Internet addiction and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, Internet freedom did not explain heterogeneity in this literature stream before and after controlling for study quality and the percentage of female participants. In support of the displacement hypothesis, this study found that Internet addiction contributes to depressive symptoms through excessive daytime sleepiness (proportion mediated = 17.48%). As the evidence suggests, excessive daytime sleepiness displaces a host of activities beneficial for maintaining mental health. The results were subjected to a battery of robustness checks and the conclusions remain unchanged.Practical implicationsThe results underscore the negative consequences of Internet addiction in adolescents. Addressing this issue would involve interventions that promote sleep hygiene and greater offline engagement with peers to alleviate depressive symptoms.Originality/valueThis study utilizes robust meta-analytic techniques to provide the most comprehensive examination of the association between Internet addiction and depressive symptoms in adolescents. The implications intersect with the shared interests of social scientists, health practitioners, and policy makers.

AB  - This study examines the displacement-reinforcement effects of social media. In referring to research framework of the satisfaction-attitudes-loyalty (SAL) chain, our model is centred on social media users, and tests the causal relationships among three principal variables associated with Facebook (FB) and YouTube (YT) and three associated with FB and Instagram (IG). The surveys were conducted at three large universities in Taiwan and included 392 and 203 valid responses from Millennial undergraduate students and older staff (excluding faculty members), respectively. While our data fit the research model and supported our hypotheses regarding the SAL core model, the hypotheses representing the effects of displacement (or reinforcement) among social media platforms were not supported for the young generation. The results demonstrated that, although IG and YT provide some unique features, they have not displaced FB nor they have become a complementary medium to FB. As for the staff group, the displacement effects between FB and YT as well as between FB and IG were identified, indicating that YT and IG may be adopted as a substitute. In the absence of reinforcement effects, neither YT nor IG was a complementary medium despite users' favourable attitudes towards and frequent use of them. The research limitations and future research directions were also discussed.

AB  - We present data from a nationally representative 2017 survey of American adults. For heterosexual couples in the United States, meeting online has become the most popular way couples meet, eclipsing meeting through friends for the first time around 2013. Moreover, among the couples who meet online, the proportion who have met through the mediation of third persons has declined over time. We find that Internet meeting is displacing the roles that family and friends once played in bringing couples together.

Adoption is hypothesized to be driven by attributes of the electronic newspaper artefact (expressed by perceived substitution) and individual cultural characteristics of potential adopters. Perceived substitution is seen as a factor that influences the displacement of printed newspapers with electronic ones.Method. Data were collected using Web surveys and consist of 1804 responses from a representative sample of individuals in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.Analysis. Partial least squares path modelling was used to test hypotheses.Results. The results indicate that perceived substitution explains the adoption of electronic newspapers well, while most cultural factors did not show a significant effect on adoption.Conclusion. These results add to research on how perceived substitutive functionality of one technology over another may lead to adoption, as well as to studies that investigate the role of individual cultural characteristics in the adoption of information and communication technologies.

TI  - Are News Media Substitutes? Gratifications, Contents, and Uses
AU  - van der Wurff, R
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDIA ECONOMICS
AB  - Internet is generally expected to have one of two effects on traditional news media: It displaces them, or it forces them into distinct market niches. A shared assumption underlying both expectations is that news media displacement, or substitution, is a function of the degree to which news media are functional equivalents. This article explores this assumption from a niche theoretical perspective, using survey data from 2 student samples as illustrative cases. Findings indicate that, for these students, news media substitution does not depend on functional equivalence of media in providing gratifications and gratification opportunities or types of content. Post hoc analyses suggest instead that, for this particular audience, media use depends on habit and media accessibility. Follow-up studies should further investigate these relations for representative samples.

TI  - The impact of online video highlights on TV audience ratings
AU  - Bae, G

T2  - ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - Short video excerpts from TV shows are a tool that producers/broadcasters use to promote their programs. This study examines how video highlights that are presented online for free viewing, which can be analogous to product samples for entertainment goods, affect TV audience ratings. We investigate whether a displacement effect exists, i.e., the substitution of goods due to the availability of other similar goods. We find that positive viewer response, measured by the number of likes and views generated for the highlights, positively affects ratings, and the square of the number of likes negatively affects ratings. Our findings suggest that if viewers are overly satisfied with the highlights, some may be satisfied with merely viewing them and refrain from watching the actual show; such a response may potentially decrease TV viewership. This is the first study to examine the role of online video highlights as a promotional tool for TV shows.

T2  - INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL
AB  - Background. The question whether old media are driven out of existence by new media has been a long concern in academic and industrial research but has received no definitive answer.Aim. This paper goes beyond most previous studies of Internet impact on traditional media, which have placed their relationship within a competition-based framework, to specifically investigate the complementary effect of online news and information usage on traditional sources.Method. Secondary data analysis of a national survey of 4270 Australians conducted in late 2003, employing hypothesis testing for the mean, partial correlations, and a linear regression analysis.Results. Online news and information usage at different usage levels is positively associated with the use of traditional news and information sources, especially those that are more information-intensive. Those who relied on the Internet the most for news and information still used traditional sources substantially.Conclusion. The findings suggest that even if a displacement effect takes place, there will be no replacement (absolute displacement): traditional media will still exist to complement the Internet in serving human beings' news and information needs.

AB  - This article investigates the impact of use of the Worldwide Web on patterns of sociability. Its sets out a neofunctionalist model of socio-technological innovation that is designed to explore prospectively the impact of innovations in areas such as information and communications technology, on the full range of sociable and nonsociable activities. It uses evidence from a unique data set (a nationally representative time diary panel study, collected in the U.K. for the period 1999-2001) to explore this model. It concludes that Internet use, contrary to "time-displacement" expectations, is not negatively associated with sociability.

TI  - Can Cellphone Shutdowns Stop Terrorist Violence? Evidence from Pakistan
AU  - Mustafa, F
T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB  - While there has been growing concern about the use of technology by terrorist groups to organize and execute violence, there has been much less academic work on the effectiveness of governmental efforts to control the use of technology to prevent terrorist violence. Governments across the world have relied on network shutdowns to tackle violence, amongst other ends. Using data from one such country, Pakistan, this paper examines the effectiveness of disrupting cellphone networks as acounterterrorism strategy to tackle terrorist violence. This paper relies on daily data on terrorist violence in Pakistan from January 2012 to December 2017 combined with data on government-mandated cellphone shutdowns. The results show a statistically significant decline in the number of terrorist attacks on the day of cellphone shutdowns and an increase in terrorist attacks on the day after cellphone shutdown. Overall, it is argued that while cellphone shutdowns might displace terrorist violence from one day to the next, they are not an effective way to tackle terrorist violence.

TI  - THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVOLVEMENT IN THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND FAMILY SOCIAL CAPITAL
AU  - Dubrov, D
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS
AB  - The study goal was to empirically test the direct and indirect effects of involve-ment in the use of information and com-munication technologies (ICT) and family social capital. To test these effects, we interviewed 104 families (parents and adolescents, n = 208). The direct effect test showed that the involvement in ICT use is a significant predictor of family social capital. At the same time, there is an inverse relation-ship: the higher the level of involvement of family members in ICT use, the lower the level of family social capital and all its components, especially trust. This means that the more adolescents and their parents are involved in ICT use (Internet, tablets, phones and other gadgets), the less they trust each other, pay attention to needs and mutual sup-port, and the relationship becomes more distant and formal. As we can see, the primary results obtained using the con-struct of "family social capital " confirm the "displacement hypothesis ", accord-ing to which involvement in ICT use reduces the time for contacts between family members and they "displace " direct interaction, making it formal. The indirect effect test showed that the involvement in ICT use is a significant mediator of the relationship between family social capital and subjective well-being. In this case, involvement in ICT use acts as a coping strategy if individu-als are not satisfied with their relation-ships with relatives. The results obtained confirm the "social compensa-tion hypothesis ".

AB  - Background: Youth display suboptimal levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Few studies have examined the existence of the "displacement hypothesis" or the effect of parental strategies on activity behaviors during the after-school period. Method(s): A total of 3471 students (12-18 years old) completed a self-report survey that assessed after-school physical activity and television (TV) use and perceived parental strategies (ie, encouragement to be active, TV-viewing rules). Participants were grouped into 4 activity groups: high TV/low active, high TV/active, low TV/low active, or low TV/active. Descriptive statistics and nominal logistic-regression analyses were conducted. Result(s): Compared with students who watched less than 1 h of TV, participants who watched >=4 h of TV were half as likely to be active after school (>=4 h; adjusted odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI.40-.65). Compared with the low TV/active group, the other activity groups were at least 1.28 times more likely to have parents that provided only 1 parental strategy (encouragement for activity or TV rules) and up to 4.7 times more likely to have parents that provided neither strategy. Discussion(s): Sedentary behaviors are associated with displacement of active pursuits. Parental strategies exert a strong influence on after-school behaviors of high school students. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc.

AU  - Straker L.
AU  - Pollock C.
AU  - Maslen B.
T2  - Ergonomics
AB  - Computer use by children at home and school is now common in many countries. Child computer exposure varies with the type of computer technology available and the child's age, gender and social group. This paper reviews the current exposure data and the evidence for positive and negative effects of computer use by children. Potential positive effects of computer use by children include enhanced cognitive development and school achievement, reduced barriers to social interaction, enhanced fine motor skills and visual processing and effective rehabilitation. Potential negative effects include threats to child safety, inappropriate content, exposure to violence, bullying, Internet 'addiction', displacement of moderate/vigorous physical activity, exposure to junk food advertising, sleep displacement, vision problems and musculoskeletal problems. The case for child specific evidence-based guidelines for wise use of computers is presented based on children using computers differently to adults, being physically, cognitively and socially different to adults, being in a state of change and development and the potential to impact on later adult risk. Progress towards child-specific guidelines is reported. Finally, a set of guideline principles is presented as the basis for more detailed guidelines on the physical, cognitive and social impact of computer use by children. The principles cover computer literacy, technology safety, child safety and privacy and appropriate social, cognitive and physical development. The majority of children in affluent communities now have substantial exposure to computers. This is likely to have significant effects on child physical, cognitive and social development. Ergonomics can provide and promote guidelines for wise use of computers by children and by doing so promote the positive effects and reduce the negative effects of computer-child, and subsequent computer-adult, interaction.

T2  - International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity
AB  - Background: In Australia and the USA, national guidelines exist for limiting children's screen-exposure to two hours per day. This study aims to determine whether exceeding the suggested guidelines for screen-based sedentary behavior is associated with reduced levels of physical activity across different geographical regions. Method(s): Data material were taken from the 2005/2006 survey of "Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study; A WHO cross-National Survey". Data were collected through questionnaires from 11-,13- and,15- year olds. The final sample included 200,615 adolescents from 39 different countries in Europe and North America. Gender and country stratified analyses regressed time spent in leisure-time vigorous physical activity (VPA) and days of 60 minutes moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on time spent in screen-based sedentary behaviors. To simplify interpretation, the estimates from each country were pooled using a meta-analytic procedure. Result(s): Exceeding 2 hrs of daily total screen-time was negatively associated with MVPA for both boys and girls, and with VPA for girls. When investigating the different types of screen-based behaviors separately, exceeding 2 hrs daily of TV viewing was associated with less MVPA for both boys and girls and less VPA for girls. Gaming was associated with less MVPA and VPA for boys, and non-gaming computer use was associated with higher levels of VPA for both genders. Stronger negative associations between physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviors were found in countries where mean levels of physical activity were relatively high. The association between physical activity and sedentary behavior was not significantly associated with national levels of screen-based sedentary behaviors. Conclusion(s): The displacement mechanism does not appear to be universal across countries. On a national level, negative associations between physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviors are less likely to be found in countries with relatively low levels of physical activity. Consequently, national guidelines for limiting children and adolescents time in screen-based sedentary behavior may not be conducive to increasing levels of physical activity in all countries. © 2010 Melkevik et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Addressing childhood obesity through increased physical activity
AU  - Hills A.P.
AU  - Okely A.D.

T2  - Nature Reviews Endocrinology
AB  - Obesity is affecting an increasing proportion of children globally. Despite an appreciation that physical activity is essential for the normal growth and development of children and prevents obesity and obesity-related health problems, too few children are physically active. A concurrent problem is that today's young people spend more time than previous generations did in sedentary pursuits, including watching television and engaging in screen-based games. Active behavior has been displaced by these inactive recreational choices, which has contributed to reductions in activity-related energy expenditure. Implementation of multifactorial solutions considered to offer the best chance of combating these trends is urgently required to redress the energy imbalance that characterizes obesity. The counterproductive 'shame and blame' mentality that apportions responsibility for the childhood obesity problem to sufferers, their parents, teachers or health-care providers needs to be changed. Instead, these groups should offer constant support and encouragement to promote appropriate physical activity in children. Failure to provide activity opportunities will increase the likelihood that the children of today will live less healthy (and possibly shorter) lives than their parents. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

T2  - International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity
AB  - Background: There are no data on physical activity and sedentary behaviours of Greek-Cypriot children and adolescents, and no study to date examined the association between these two behaviours in this population. The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of physical activity and sedentary behaviours among Greek-Cypriot adolescents and examine the association between physical activity and a range of sedentary behaviours. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between physical activity and sedentary behaviours. Method(s): A cross-sectional study among 1,966 Greek-Cypriot children and adolescents was conducted in 2008/2009. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire across primary, middle, high and technical/vocational schools. Result(s): Overall 52.3% and 52.4% of the participants met physical activity and television viewing guidelines respectively. Boys and younger children were more likely to meet guidelines. Boys who attended sports clubs for two or more times per week were more likely to be physically active (OR = 3.4), and those who listened to music for one or less than one hour per day were less likely to be physically active (OR = 0.6). Girls who attended sports clubs for two or more times per week and who watched television for two or less than two hours per day were more likely to be physically active, (OR = 3.0 and OR = 1.5 respectively). Girls who reported travelling by car/bus/motorbike for one or less than one hour per day were more likely to actively travel to school (OR = 1.8). Conclusion(s): Findings from this study provide limited support for the displacement hypothesis whereby sedentary behaviours displace physically active time. About 50.0% of Greek children and adolescents in Cyprus meet existing physical activity and television viewing guidelines. Encouraging children to attend sports clubs for at least two times per week may markedly improve their physical activity levels. © 2011 Loucaides et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in developed countries. Sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming are thought to displace active behaviors and are independently associated with obesity. Active video games, where players physically interact with images onscreen, may have utility as a novel intervention to increase physical activity and improve body composition in children. The aim of the Electronic Games to Aid Motivation to Exercise (eGAME) study is to determine the effects of an active video game intervention over 6 months on: body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, cardio-respiratory fitness, and physical activity levels in overweight children. Methods/Design: Three hundred and thirty participants aged 10-14 years will be randomized to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). Discussion(s): An overview of the eGAME study is presented, providing an example of a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in a community setting. Reflection is offered on key issues encountered during the course of the study. In particular, investigation into the feasibility of the proposed intervention, as well as robust testing of proposed study procedures is a critical step prior to implementation of a large-scale trial.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the relationship between television (TV) viewing and weight status in preschool aged children are not well understood. This study aimed to explore the relationships between preschool children's TV viewing habits (i.e. time spent viewing, content watched and foods eaten while viewing), daily food intake, general physical activity levels and their body mass index (BMI). A cross-sectional sample of preschool children in Melbourne (n = 135). Mothers of preschoolers completed a 3-day TV diary; information was collected on viewing time, content and food consumed while watching TV. Mothers also reported their child's height, weight and physical activity behaviour. Associations between study and outcome variables were determined by bivariate correlations and hierarchical regression analyses. Mean age of preschoolers was 4.5 years and 14% were overweight or obese. The mean daily time spent watching TV was 90.7 minutes (SD 50.7) A small, positive correlation was found between viewing TV on weekdays and child BMIz, (p<0.05). This effect was moderate when controlled for total kilojoules consumed while watching TV (on weekdays) and number of minutes spent in sedentary activities (across three days). This study suggests that TV viewing may affect preschool child weight status through displacement of physical activity or eating while viewing.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between socio-demographic factors, screen media time usage, and light, moderate and vigorous activities on weekdays and weekends. Cross-sectional data was collected from 323 Spanish adolescents (mean age 13.59 years) who completed an interview administered recall questionnaire. Structural equation models indicated that male and younger adolescents spent more time on vigorous activities at the weekend, while females and older adolescents showed a greater involvement in light activities both on weekdays and weekends. State school students reported engaging in light and vigorous activities for longer periods than private school students on weekends. TV viewing was negatively linked to vigorous activities during weekdays and to light and moderate activities on weekends. The amount of mobile phone usage, however, was positively linked to light activities during weekdays, but negatively on weekends. The negative relationship between adolescents' use of screen media (TV and mobile phone) and physical activity and its possible displacement, depending on the type of day, added useful comparable knowledge for policies promoting an active lifestyle. Further research is required to provide evidence of the causality in the observed relationships. © 2010 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

T2  - Nutricion hospitalaria
AB  - Paediatric overweight continues to be a public health problem, and the etiology of obesity is multifactorial and complex. Dietary patterns, physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviors are acknowledged as major behavioural determinants of obesity. New technologies and electronic based activities have produced a decrease in PA levels, and an increase in sedentary activities in children and adolescents. Potential mechanisms that explain the association between TV viewing and childhood obesity are: displacement of PA, unhealthy food preferences produced by food advertisements, a higher energy intake by automatic eating and overconsumption caused by distraction. Interventions aimed to reduce time in sedentary behaviours are in children generally positive. However, their benefits on adiposity markers are small. Thus, if global and macro-level obesogenic factors are not changed substantially, the interventions oriented to prevent obesity will produce small benefits. Copyright © AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2013.

AB  - The isotemporal substitution model (ISM) was previously developed as a methodology to study the time-substitution effects of 1 type of activity for another in a data setting with continuous outcomes. To demonstrate the application of ISM with a dichotomous outcome, we prospectively examined the associations of different activities with various activity displacements with depression risk among 32,900 US women from the Nurses' Health Study who were free from depressive symptoms at baseline (in 1996). During a 10-year follow-up, 5,730 incident depression cases were documented. Results from the ISMs indicated that for each physical activity, differences in magnitude of effects of each activity type were observed, dependent on the activity being displaced/substituted. Notably, an isotemporal substitution gradient was found for television watching, in which its association with depression risk varied by its substitution for slow-, average-, or brisk-paced walking in a gradient toward high depression risk when television watching replaced a faster walking pace (relative risk = 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.31). Conversely, no association with depression was found for replacement of television watching with 60 minutes/day of slow walking, whereas a lower depression risk (relative risk = 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.95) was found when 60 minutes/day of brisk walking replaced 60 minutes/day of television watching. Thus, the ISM could offer a more meaningful alternative to the standard nonsubstitution models to support public health recommendations. © 2013 The Author.

TI  - Facebook and its effects on users' empathic social skills and life satisfaction: a double-edged sword effect
AU  - Chan T.H.
T2  - Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking
AB  - This study examines how Facebook usage affects individual's empathic social skills and life satisfaction. Following the self-presentational theory, the study explores a key component of the Internet paradox-whether Facebook suppresses or enhances users' interpersonal competence (specifically empathic social skills), given their respective personality makeup. Going further, the study assesses these events' subsequent impacts on users' psychological well-being. Analogous to a double-edged sword, Facebook activities are hypothesized to suppress the positive effect of a user's extraversion orientation on empathic social skills but lessen the negative effect of neuroticism on these skills. The study examines a sample of college-aged Facebook users (n=515), who responded to a large-scale online survey. The findings from a structural equation modeling analysis indicate that while empathic social skills are positively associated with life satisfaction, Facebook activities mainly exert suppression effects. Only upon low usage can Facebook activities lessen the negative effect of neuroticism on empathic social skills, suggesting that Facebook may appear as a less threatening platform for social interactions among neurotics. Yet, results in general suggest that undesirable effects may occur at high levels of Facebook usage whereby both extroverted and neurotic users displace real world social ties to online ones. The findings point to the complex ways in which social media usage may impact the livelihood of users.

AB  - This study examines the association between objectively-measured physical activity (PA) intensities and sedentary behavior (SED) in a cohort of 532 children aged 8-10 y. PA and SED were assessed by accelerometer over 7-days. Television and computer/video-game use were self-reported. Associations between PA intensities and SED variables were assessed by Spearman correlations and adjusted multiple linear regression. Higher mean daily moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous PA (MVPA, VPA) were negatively associated with mean daily SED (r = -0.47 and -0.37; p < .001), and positively associated with mean daily total PA (r = .58 and 0.46; p < .001). MVPA was also positively associated with light PA (LPA; r = .26, p < .001). MVPA and VPA were not significantly associated with TV, computer/video or total screen time; accelerometer SED was only weakly associated with specific SED behaviors. On average, for each additional 10 min daily MVPA, children accumulated >14 min less SED, and for each additional 5 min VPA, 11 min less SED. Thus, over the course of a week, higher mean daily MVPA may displace SED time and is associated with higher total PA over and above the additional MVPA, due to concomitant higher levels of LPA. Public health strategies should target both MVPA and SED to improve overall PA and health in children.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the relationship between screen time and physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents but also to determine specific elements of PA that were most closely associated with screen time. We studied a cross-sectional sample of 6176 10.0-15.9 year olds (53% boys, 12.9 +/- 1.5 years) who completed the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children/Adolescents and reported daily screen time. Differences in total PA and specific elements of PA were examined between groups reporting: < 2 h, 2-4 h, and > 4 h daily screen time. There were significant differences between screen time groups in: total PA, number of bouts of PA reported, after school PA, evening PA and weekend PA (P < .0001). There was a graded, negative association between higher screen time and lower free-time PA. Participants reporting < 2 h screen time were also significantly more active during school lunch breaks than those reporting > 2 h. Boys reporting > 4 h screen time were less active during physical education lessons. Screen time is significantly and negatively associated with PA in British youth. Screen time may displace active pursuits out of school but is also associated with lower PA during school. Daily screen time should be limited to < 2 h in line with current recommendations.

AB  - Background: The prevention and treatment of childhood obesity is a key public health challenge. However, certain groups within populations have markedly different risk profiles for obesity and related health behaviours. Well-designed subgroup analysis can identify potential differential effects of obesity interventions, which may be important for reducing health inequalities. The study aim was to evaluate the consistency of the effects of active video games across important subgroups in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Finding(s): A two-arm, parallel RCT was conducted in overweight or obese children (n = 322; aged 10-14 years) to determine the effect of active video games on body composition. Statistically significant overall treatment effects favouring the intervention group were found for body mass index, body mass index z-score and percentage body fat at 24 weeks. For these outcomes, pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted among important baseline demographic (ethnicity, sex) and prognostic (cardiovascular fitness) groups. No statistically significant interaction effects were found between the treatment and subgroup terms in the main regression model (p = 0.36 to 0.93), indicating a consistent treatment effect across these groups. Conclusion(s): Preliminary evidence suggests an active video games intervention had a consistent positive effect on body composition among important subgroups. This may support the use of these games as a pragmatic public health intervention to displace sedentary behaviour with physical activity in young people. © 2014 Foley et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

T2  - Traffic injury prevention
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether cell phone use by drivers leads to changes in the frequency of other types of potentially distracting behavior. There were 2 main questions of interest: (1) As each driver changes cell phone use, does he or she change the amount of driving time spent on other distracting behavior? (2) As each driver changes cell phone use, does he or she change the amount of driving time spent looking away from the driving task?, METHODS: Day-to-day driving behavior of 105 volunteer subjects was monitored over a period of 1 year. The amount of driving time during each trip spent on tasks secondary to driving (or looking away from the driving task) was correlated to the amount of time on a cell phone, taking into account the relationships among trips taken by the same driver., RESULTS: Drivers spent 42% of the time engaging in at least one secondary activity. Drivers were talking on a cell phone 7% of the time, interacting in some other way with a cell phone 5% of the time, and engaging in some other secondary activity (sometimes in conjunction with cell phone use) 33% of the time. Other than cell phone use, the most common secondary activities were interacting with a passenger (12% of driving time), holding but not otherwise interacting with an object (6%), and talking/singing/dancing to oneself (5%). Drivers were looking straight forward 81% of the time, forward left or right 5% of time, in a mirror 4% of the time, and elsewhere (eyes off driving task) 10% of time. On average, for each 1 percentage point increase in cell phone talking, the other secondary behavior rate decreased by 0.28 percentage points (P <.0001), and the rate of eyes off driving task decreased by 0.02 percentage points (P =.0067). For each 1 percentage point increase in the amount of other cell phone interaction per trip, the other secondary behavior rate decreased by 0.08 percentage points (P =.0558), but the rate of eyes off driving task increased by 0.06 percentage points (P <.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Although using a cell phone can be distracting from the driving task, other secondary activities can be equally or more distracting, at least as measured by eye glances away from the road ahead and mirrors. In this group of drivers, dialing, reaching for, and answering the cell phone were associated with increased eyes off driving task, as opposed to the decrease in eyes off driving task associated with talking on the phone. Predictions about the effect of cell phone usage on driver distraction need to consider what other behavior is being displaced by the time spent on the phone. A focus by researchers, policy-makers, and the media on the distraction of using cell phones while driving may lead drivers to disregard the risk of other secondary behavior that is even more distracting.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate changes in use of time when undertaking a structured exercise program. Design(s): This study used a randomized, multi-arm, controlled trial design. Method(s): A total of 129 insufficiently active adults aged 18-60 years were recruited and randomly allocated to one of three groups, a Moderate or Extensive six-week exercise group (150 and 300 additional minutes of exercise per week, respectively) or a Control group. Prescribed exercise was accumulated through both group and individual sessions. Use of time was measured at baseline and end-program using the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults, a computerized 24-h recall instrument. Daily minutes of activity in activity domains and energy expenditure zones were determined. Result(s): Relative to changes in the control group, daily time spent in the physical activity [F (2, 108)=20.21, p<. 0.001] and Active Transport [F (2, 108)=3.71, p=0.03] time use domains significantly increased in the intervention groups by 21-45. min/day. Comparatively, the intervention groups spent significantly less time watching television [F (2, 108)=5.02, p=0.008; -50-52. min/day], relative to Controls. Additionally, time spent in the moderate to vigorous energy expenditure zone had significantly increased in the intervention groups by end-program [F (2, 108)=6.35, p=0.002; 48-50. min/day], relative to Controls. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to comprehensively map changes in time use across an exercise program. The results suggest that exercise interventions should be mindful not only of compliance but also of "isotemporal displacement" of behaviors.Copyright © 2014 Sports Medicine Australia.

TI  - A Self-Determination Perspective on Online Health Information Seeking: The Internet vs. Face-to-Face Office Visits With Physicians
AU  - Lee S.T.
AU  - Lin J.
T2  - Journal of health communication
AB  - This study elucidates the experiential and motivational aspects of online health information beyond the theoretically limited instrumental perspective that dominates the extant literature. Based on a sample of 993 online health information seekers in India, the survey found that online health information seeking offers individuals greater autonomy, competence, and relatedness compared to face-to-face office visits with physicians. According to self-determination theory, individuals are motivated to act by a sense of volition and experience of willingness, validation of one's skills and competencies, and feeling of connection with others who shaped one's decisions. These 3 psychological needs, which motivate individuals to pursue what they innately seek as human beings, help explain why individuals turn online for health information. T tests showed that all 3 self-determination theory constructs -autonomy, competence, and relatedness-were higher for online health information seeking than for face-to-face office visits with physicians. A regression analysis found that 2 variables, autonomy and relatedness, explained online health information seeking. Competence was not a significant factor, likely because of competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting, understanding, and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative channel for health information.

AB  - PURPOSE: Mobile technology is ubiquitous, but its impact on family life has not been thoroughly addressed in the scientific literature or in clinical practice guidelines. We aimed to understand parents' views regarding mobile technology use by young children, aged 0 to 8 years, including perceived benefits, concerns, and effects on family interactions, with the goal of informing pediatric guidelines., METHODS: We conducted 35 in-depth, semistructured group and individual interviews with English-speaking caregivers of diverse ethnic backgrounds, educational levels, and employment statuses. After thematic saturation, results were validated through expert triangulation and member checking., RESULTS: Participants included 22 mothers, 9 fathers, and 4 grandmothers; 31.4% were single parents, 42.9% were of nonwhite race or ethnicity, and 40.0% completed high school or less. Participants consistently expressed a high degree of tension regarding their child's mobile technology use, from which several themes emerged: (1) effects on the child-fear of missing out on educational benefits vs concerns about negative effects on thinking and imagination; (2) locus of control-wanting to use digital devices in beneficial ways vs feeling that rapidly evolving technologies are beyond their control (a tension more common in low-income caregivers); and (3) family stress-the necessity of device use in stressed families (eg, to control a child's behavior or as an inexpensive learning/entertainment tool) vs its displacement of family time., CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of young children describe many novel concepts regarding use of mobile technology, raising issues not addressed by current anticipatory guidance. Guidance may be more effectively implemented if it takes into account parents' uncertainties, locus of control, and functional uses of mobile devices in families.Copyright © 2016 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

AB  - METHODS: An online survey of exergame preferences, social cognition (theory of planned behavior), and behaviors that parents perceive as displaced during exergaming was conducted among a representative sample of 483 Canadian parents with a child between the ages of 6 and 14 years of age who own a videogame platform in their family home., RESULTS: Three quarters of parents indicated that they played exergames with their children but play time averaged a single bout every second week (mean = 29 minutes per bout). Parents overwhelmingly preferred to play sports and dance exergames with their children on weekends (80.1%) and during inclement weather (i.e., rainy = 51.3%; snowy = 45.5%). Family exergame playtime was associated with intention, affective and instrumental attitudes, and descriptive norm. TV watching was reported as being the most common activity that exergames would displace (64.1%)., DISCUSSION: Findings suggest that exergames could be a potentially viable option for family PA, especially during bad weather and on weekends to help increase total PA. Intervention efforts could benefit from promoting the social aspects of family exergaming and attitudinal factors., OBJECTIVES: The family home is an important environment for reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity (PA). Exergames are gaining attention as a possible modality for increasing energy expenditure within the home setting. The purpose of this study was to explore the use, correlates, and preferences of family exergaming.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms explaining the positive relationship between television (TV) viewing and body mass index (BMI) are unclear. 'Mindless eating' and 'physical activity displacement' theories have been suggested, but have not been tested longitudinally among young adults. This study aimed to determine whether longitudinal associations between young adults' TV viewing and BMI are explained by changes in TV-related food and beverage consumption (FBC) and/or leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) over 5 years among young adults. METHOD(S): A cohort of young Australian adults (n = 1068) was assessed in 2004-6 (T1) and 2009-2011 (T2), height and weight were measured (T1) or self-reported (T2), and participants self-reported TV viewing time (hours/day), weekly TV-related FBC and LTPA (mins/week). Linear regression was used to examine direct pathways between TV viewing and BMI, adjusting for TV-related FBC and LTPA to examine indirect pathways. RESULT(S): The association between TV viewing time and BMI (beta: 0.41, 95% CI 0.03, 0.78 for > 1-h increase in TV viewing/day) was not explained by TV-related FBC (beta: 0.37, 95% CI -0.18, 0.91) or LTPA (beta: 0.38, 95% CI -0.17, 0.93) hypotheses. Increased TV-related FBC was associated with increased TV viewing (0.39 +/- 1.54 h/day) and greater increases in BMI (0.92 +/- 2.28 kg/m2, p = 0.16). LTPA increases were not associated with changes in TV viewing (- 0.07 +/- 1.42 h/day), and increases in BMI were smallest when LTPA increased (0.44 +/- 2.25 kg/m2) and greatest when LTPA decreased (0.82 +/- 2.30 kg/m2) (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION(S): Factors other than changes in TV-related FBC or LTPA may explain the longitudinal relationship between TV viewing and increasing BMI among young adults. Findings confirm that TV viewing is a risk factor for weight gain in young adults but the underlying causal mechanisms remain unclear.

TI  - A Desire for Social Media Is Associated With a Desire for Solitary but Not Social Activities
AU  - Hill L.
AU  - Zheng Z.
T2  - Psychological reports
AB  - While social media is an aspect of life for many, it brings to light the lack of interpersonal connection when browsing activity occurs. The displacement theory suggests that the quality of one's offline interactions is affected by how much time an individual allots to those exchanges. Depending on the amount of time spent online, interpersonal connections may suffer and lead to negative psychological consequences. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between the desirability of social media and socialization preferences through a cue-based perceptual judgment task where participants ( N = 136) rated 40 gray-scale images in terms of their desirability. The image categories included social media icons, singular scenes depicting an isolated activity, social scenes representing an interactive activity, and traffic signs as the control. We also included questionnaires to assess depressiveness and aspects of social media usage. Our findings suggest that the immediate desire for social media is potentially linked to one's desire for social isolation as represented by the singular scene category, the intensity of participant's reported daily usage, and the extent to which social media is perceived to impact real social life. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the initial desirability judgment of social media and its association with other factors. Further research is needed to distinguish the variability in users' aim of using social media and if that is related to one's perceived feelings of social connectedness and solitude.

T2  - Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science
AB  - With the rise of online social networking, social relationships are increasingly developed and maintained in a digital domain. Drawing conclusions about the impact of the digital world on loneliness is difficult because there are contradictory findings, and cross-sectional studies dominate the literature, making causation difficult to establish. In this review, we present our theoretical model and propose that there is a bidirectional and dynamic relationship between loneliness and social Internet use. When the Internet is used as a way station on the route to enhancing existing relationships and forging new social connections, it is a useful tool for reducing loneliness. But when social technologies are used to escape the social world and withdraw from the "social pain" of interaction, feelings of loneliness are increased. We propose that loneliness is also a determinant of how people interact with the digital world. Lonely people express a preference for using the Internet for social interaction and are more likely to use the Internet in a way that displaces time spent in offline social activities. This suggests that lonely people may need support with their social Internet use so that they employ it in a way that enhances existing friendships and/or to forge new ones.

AU  - Moorman J.D.

T2  - Health communication
AB  - Greater consumption of and access to screen media are known correlates of unhealthy sleep behavior in preschoolers. What remains unknown, however, is the role a child's media use plays in this association. Parents and guardians of U.S. preschoolers (N = 278, average child age 56 months) provided information about their child's nightly duration of sleep, daily duration of nap, quantity of screen media use, sneaky media use, and the presence of a screen media device in the bedroom. We assessed four media: television, DVD/VCRs, video games, and computer/Internet. Based on rationales of sleep displacement, the forbidden fruit hypothesis, and social cognitive theory, we predicted that increased consumption of and access to media, along with sneaky media use, would predict a shorter duration of nightly sleep and longer duration of daily nap across the four screen media. In correlational analyses, a clear pattern emerged with quantity of media use, screen media in the bedroom, and sneaky media use associated with shorter nightly duration of sleep and longer duration of daily nap. In regression analyses, only weekday evening television viewing and sneaky media use predicted shorter nightly sleep duration; weekend morning and evening DVD use predicted longer naps.

T2  - Current Sleep Medicine Reports
AB  - Purpose of Review: The screen-based media landscape has changed markedly during the last decade, with 95% of American teens owning or having access to a smartphone. Coinciding with the rise in digital media devices, researchers have noted a high prevalence of insufficient sleep among youth. In this article, we review recent literature about adolescents' screen use behaviors and sleep health outcomes published between 2015 and 2019. Recent Findings: Overall, we found a high level of screen use and poor sleep health (i.e., short duration, poor quality, late timing) among adolescents. The great majority of recent observational studies demonstrated a robust inverse association between screen media device use and sleep outcomes among adolescents all over the world. Screen-based media use has also been linked to a series of adverse psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, partially if not fully mediated through impaired sleep health. Experimental data, however, offer mixed findings on the causal relationship between teen media use and sleep. In addition, there is uncertainty as to the relative roles of the proposed mechanisms underlying those relationships, whether driven by the light emitted by devices, time displacement, or the media content affecting psychological state (e.g., fear of missing out, anxiety). Summary: Current empirical research demonstrates that screen-based digital media use is closely associated with sleep duration and sleep quality among teens; however, limited data show a direct causal effect of screen-based media use on adolescent sleep health. With very few studies demonstrating easy-to-implement and effective interventions, we argue that more basic, translational, and clinical research is necessary.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to give a detailed overview on the leisure behavior of adolescents (frequency, differences between gender, age groups and social class, time trends, and inter-relations). In total, 1449 10- to 18-year-old German adolescents were included in the study. Participants answered questionnaires about their media use, physical activity, outdoor time, engagement in choir/orchestra and theater/dancing, social life and socio-economic status (SES). The results revealed that girls, children with lower SES as well as older children reported to use screen-based media more often and that girls, older children and children with lower SES were less physically active. In addition, boys and children with lower SES engaged less frequently in choir/orchestra and theater/dancing, while children with higher SES met their friends more often. The time trend analysis showed that mobile phone use increased drastically from 2011 to 2017, while engagement in choir/orchestra and theater/dancing decreased. Regarding the inter-relation between leisure activities, high screen times were significantly associated with less physical activity and less outdoor time. Physical activity, in contrast, was significantly related to better social life and more outdoor time. These findings highlight the growing importance of electronic media in adolescents' lives and their tendency to displace other leisure activities.

AB  - Limited screen time has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for all children and no screen time for children under 2 years of age. With the advancement in technology, the prevalence and detrimental effects of excess screen time on children has become a global problem that can lead to health issues such as obesity and other cardiovascular diseases among both adults and children. This article examines the drivers of screen-related sedentary behavior within the home context and reports on parents' attitude in supporting children's associated behavior. The study implemented a mixed method approach of online questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. A total of 140 questionnaires, 10 semistructured interviews, and responses from parents were used to evaluate children's behavior toward screen use and parents' perception. The analysis of the article has shown that parents are concerned about their children's screen time during weekends and holidays with a significant correlation between the number of hours their children spend on on-screen activities and their level of concern (P <.01). Also, for the same P value (P <.01), it has been found that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between children's screen time and their food and beverages consumption. Children's use of screen technology is becoming a challenge for parents as they present barriers to healthy physical activities. From the parents' viewpoint, there is a need to change the screen use habit and this requires an appropriate intervention that promotes gratifying measures to induce more active behaviors to displace screen viewing.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Given the myriad of media channels and available health information, it is important to investigate how health consumers navigate and choose from multiple media channels in seeking health information and their preferences among different media sources. Previous research has routinely measured health information-seeking behavior (HISB), especially online health information seeking as a whole, which does not capture the complexity and diversity of media channels used in HISB. On the basis of the channel complementarity theory, this study further classified new media into search engines, social media, and mobile health applications. The results of a secondary analysis of the Health Information National Trends Survey in China (HINTS-China) reinforced the occurrence of media complementary between information-oriented media (newspapers and magazines) and entertainment-oriented media (television). In addition, people used traditional media complementarily with new media, except information-oriented media and search engine use exhibited a displacement relationship. Moreover, the results indicated different profiles of health information seekers varied according to the diverse media channels, although media trust, perceived poor health status, chronic disease, and family cancer history consistently propelled HISB for both online and offline media channels. Implications for theory and practice for health communication were discussed.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 23(5) of Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication (see record 2018-43816-005). The title of article published with a typo. The correct title of the article is "It Takes at Least Two to Tango: A Population-Level Perspective on Interrelated Patterns of Media Use".] We introduce a population-level perspective on the longstanding debate on displacement versus complementarity by recognizing that an individual's social interactions are dependent on emerging media use patterns in the wider population. Our longitudinal, cross-regional analyses at the population-level and individual-level indicate that two opposing forces coexist: individual Internet use and individual face-to-face (f2f) interaction are positively correlated, suggesting complementarity. However, local peers' Internet use and individual f2f interactions are negatively related, suggesting displacement. Interestingly, when social networking site uptake is high, individual Internet non-use is associated with a more pronounced negative association between peers' Internet use and individual-level f2f interactions. We discuss the implications of coexisting individual-level complementarity and population-level displacement for both users and non-users.

AB  - Theories regarding the impact of media on development can largely be grouped into content-based and content-independent categories. Content-based theories argue that the impact of media on aspects of development differs depending on content. For example, media that involve prosocial themes (eg, helping) may positively impact children's behavior, whereas media that involve violence have the potential to negatively impact behavior. Content-independent theories argue that many of the impacts of media occur irrespective of the content children are exposed to. For example, irrespective of content, viewing media may displace other activities (eg, reading) that positively contribute to children's intellectual development. A third theory that contains both content-based and content-independent elements is based on media form. Briefly, form-based theories argue that specific features of media may negatively impact children's behavior. Although form-based theories are generally classified as content-independent, many forms commonly intersect with certain types of content (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Educational Psychology Review
AB  - The popularity of social networking sites (SNSs) among adolescents and young adults has raised concerns that the intensity of using these platforms might be associated with lower academic achievement. The empirical findings on this issue, however, are anything but conclusive. Therefore, we present four random-effects meta-analyses including 59 independent samples (total N = 29,337) on the association between patterns of SNS use and grades. The meta-analyses identified small negative effects of rho = -.07, 95% CI [- .12, -.02] for general SNS use and rho = -.10, 95% CI [-.16, -.05] for SNS use related to multitasking. General SNS use was unrelated to the time spent studying for school (rho = -.03, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.06]) and no support for the time displacement hypothesis could be found in a meta-analytical mediation analysis. SNS use for academic purposes exhibited a small positive association, rho = .08, 95% CI [.02, .14]. Hypotheses with regard to cross-cultural differences were not supported.

AB  - This work, situated in the Greek sociocultural context, attempts to analyze the time spent by primary school students on digital and traditional extracurricular activities and the impact of these activities on the educational outcome. The first objective was to determine, by means of a quantitative survey, if the children as "digital natives" replace traditional entertainment activities with new digital technologies or if, on the contrary, they supplement them with the novel forms of entertainment. A second objective was to examine the impact of the frequency of extracurricular activities with and without screens on the school performance. Our final objective was to explore the existence of distinct user profiles based on the extracurricular activities with and without screens and to identify the relationship between different types of extracurricular activities.

T2  - Mass Communication & Society
AB  - Through analysis of five focus groups with people who "usually (more often than not) listened to at least one podcast episode a week" in the last two months, this uses and gratifications (U&G) study uncovers several prominent themes among podcast listener experiences. In an effort to integrate old and new media use typologies within U&G research, our results are presented in two parts: emerging typologies and expansions of existing typologies. The emerging section includes reasons for podcast displacement of other media, customizable experiences, and multitasking (which involves both temptation bundling and feeding the brain). The expansion builds on the existing typologies of companionship and interaction by analyzing avenues for parasocial relationship formation and identifying social opportunities as well as social frustrations surrounding podcasts. We ultimately conclude that podcasts offer an endless supply of engaging content that travels with listeners, allowing them to be "productive" in various physical and mind-expanding ways. The enjoyment is facilitated in part by forging connections with hosts and other listeners. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Selective motion: Media displacement among older Internet users.
AU  - Nimrod, Galit
T2  - Information, Communication & Society
AB  - An increasing number of studies explore various aspects of new media use in later life, but most ignore the parallel use of traditional mass media among older adults. Relying on technological and functional approaches in communications research, this study explores how media displacement processes serve as mechanisms that regulate seniors' media consumption in various sociocultural environments. The study is based on a survey of 6989 Internet users aged 60 and older from six countries (Austria, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain), and compares usage rates and time spent using old media with that allotted to consumption of their digital equivalents. Furthermore, it examines levels of media displacement in different countries and explores the factors explaining such displacement. Results indicate a high media displacement with regard to newspapers and magazines, followed by book reading, with a relatively marginal transition to online TV and radio. Displacement levels vary among participating countries and are highest in Spain and Israel, with differences remaining significant even after controlling for background characteristics. The most significant displacement predictor, however, is the variety of users' online activities. These findings suggest that despite the increasing percentage of older Internet users, this audience tends to adhere to familiar media practices. Nevertheless, it also exhibits selective displacement that is highly dependent on users' media habits, the relative advantages of each medium and sociocultural contexts. Such selectivity may be considered a specific strategy for setting, pursuing and maintaining personal goals in later life. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
AB  - The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs), instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, self-presentation, and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming SNSs' content was associated with poorer well-being.

AB  - The augmentation and displacement hypotheses generated two mediators for the relationship between social media use and mental health. A representative online sample of 1157 New Zealanders (stratified on age, gender, and region) were measured on social media use for networking, offline social capital, internet addiction, anxiety, and depression. Results showed that social media use for networking's relationship with anxiety and depression was mediated by both offline social capital and internet addiction. Anxiety and depression were lower when mediated by offline social capital, and higher when mediated by internet addiction. Applied to everyday social life, this suggests that when someone uses social media to build on pre-existing offline social capital, their mental health is "augmented". However, if their online social connections are unrelated to their offline social capital, this might be associated with an internet addiction where their offline social life is "displaced" by over-reliance on brittle online connections.

AB  - Are some games becoming extinct, or have they been renamed, adapted or reformed. A belief that 'play as we have known it' is disappearing is not new. The current impact of technology on play and leisure activities has made some wonder once again how traditional forms of play can survive. Games, toys, stories, play activities are always evolving and being reframed as they are influenced by the environments and communities in which children live. Many games including playground games are extensions of stories that have been read, movies or online video content watched on personal devices. A significant portion of children's lives now involves sitting, watching or playing with screens. The problem is not with the technology or even the content necessarily, but with that displacement of time and resourcing that historically was allocated to other activities or pursuits. This chapter first explores the place of traditional and contemporary games in today's playgrounds and secondly considers the impact that technology and screen time has had on the choice of children's playground activities.

AB  - The ubiquity of the Internet in all domains of human communication merits a renewed focus on the channel complementarity and displacement hypotheses, not least because social media enables the sharing of information beyond information-seeking. The present study draws on a cross-sectional survey, conducted during the 2014 national election in India. Findings indicate that exposure to traditional media significantly predicted exposure to social media. Sharing text messages, discussing the campaign face-to-face, listening to the radio, and campaign interest predicted sharing information on social media. The findings provide important insights into channel complementarity theory, demonstrating the positive relationship between traditional and new media-based exposure and information-sharing.

AB  - This study examined how Internet use is related to subjective well-being, using longitudinal data from 19 nations with representative online samples stratified for age, gender, and region (N = 7122, 51.43% women, Mage = 45.26). Life satisfaction and anxiety served as indices of subjective well-being at time 1 (t1) and then six months later (t2). Frequency of Internet use (hours online per day) at t1 correlated with lower life satisfaction, r =-.06, and more anxiety, r = .13 at t2. However, after imposing multivariate controls, frequency of internet use (t1) was no longer associated with lower subjective well-being (t2). Frequency of social contact by internet and use of internet for following rumors (t1) predicted higher anxiety (t2). Higher levels of direct (face-to-face plus phone) social contact (t1) predicted greater life satisfaction (t2). In multivariate analyses, all effect sizes were small. Society-level individualism-collectivism or indulgence-restraint did not show a direct effect on outcomes nor moderate individual-level associations. Results are discussed in the framework of the Internet as a displacement of social contact versus a replacement of deficits in direct contact; and as a source of positive and negative information.

T2  - Digitising early childhood.
AB  - Young children increasingly have play experiences that transverse digital and non-digital spaces (Giddings 2014; Kervin, Verenikina and Rivera 2015; Marsh et al. 2016). However, while many children play digital games, many do not. As conversations about children's digital worlds shift from a focus on risks and harm, toward ensuring provision of opportunities for maximizing benefits associated with digital media (Livingstone and Third 2017), there is a need to consider the permissive and restrictive forces acting on these opportunities. This chapter considers the views of parents of young (3-5 year-old) children who do not play any digital games. Data was collected through text responses to part of a larger survey about children's digital gaming practices. The reasons parents gave for their children not playing any digital games are presented and discussed. This group of parents construct play in utilitarian terms and digital games, talked about as a form of "screen time", are thought to either displace time away from more beneficial types of play, do not add anything of value to, or actively cause some harm to, children's development. These findings are subsequently contrasted with current early years education frameworks which include the use of technology-for example, digital games-in learning tasks and outcomes. The researchers urge educators and media scholars alike to consider these parental constructions as influential components of the context of children's informal experiences with digital games at home.

TI  - Parent distraction with phones, reasons for use, and impacts on parenting and child outcomes: A review of the emerging research.
AU  - McDaniel, Brandon T
T2  - Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies
AB  - The current article reviews the emerging research related to parent distraction with phones and mobile devices. From this review, it is clear that parent distraction with phones and mobile devices while around children has become common. This is concerning, as the evidence suggests links with parenting and child outcomes-such as lower awareness and sensitivity, fewer verbal and nonverbal interactions, less coordinated parenting and coparenting, dissatisfaction with time spent together, and negative child reactions (e.g., problem behaviors). The issue is complex, however, as many reasons may drive parents to use devices around children, such as strong habits, device notifications, work/social pressures, parenting stress, and boredom or loneliness. Ultimately, parenting is affected due to displacement of time with children, difficulty of multitasking between device and child, and the emotions and stresses that can come from device use. Research gaps are found and future directions are proposed. Most findings come from self-reports or observations. More longitudinal and experimental work is needed to establish causation. Furthermore, as parents and children are concerned about phone use during family time, it is important for evidence-based programs to be developed to address healthy device habits specifically during family time and social interactions.

AB  - This chapter examines the dynamic relations between media and family. It presents how media impacts the parent-child relationship, including how parents monitor their child's media use and the impact this has on the relationship and the child's behavior. The chapter also examines how media is a part of both sibling and couple relationships, with both positive and negative relationship outcomes. It highlights an impressive body of research that has considered the intersection between media and family, with numerous useful conclusions and as many unanswered questions. The chapter briefly discusses family systems theory, displacement theory, and a multitheoretical approach to provide scholars with numerous options when considering the important ways in which family scholars and media scholars can communicate with one another. It encourages continued research on the ways in which families can use media as a source of cohesion or strengthening use media together. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Journal of Family Theory & Review
AB  - Children's screen time (i.e., time spent using computers, televisions, mobile devices) has rapidly increased with the development of mobile technology, and this increase has become a matter of serious concern for teachers, parents, family life educators, psychologists, and other health professionals. High usage rates (more than 2 hours per day) have been associated with low-quality sleep, language acquisition difficulties, and attentional problems in young children. Results of experimental trials to limit screen time have been mixed. Interventions may be improved with guidance from a systematic theoretical framework focused directly on children's well-being. This article proposes a multifaceted goal-theoretic approach to reducing screen time through involvement in alternative activities. It is proposed that a focus on approach goals involving shared activities that are constitutive of children's well-being can naturally displace excessive screen time, enhance child development, reduce parental stress, and improve familial well-being.

T2  - The psychology and dynamics behind social media interactions.
AB  - Sleep is essential for physical and mental wellbeing, but many adults and adolescents do not get the recommended amount of sleep. Recently, studies have identified technology use as having negative impacts on sleep. This is concerning given that mobile technologies have permeated the lives of today's young adults and adolescents. First, the effects of social media use, both throughout the day and before bedtime, on sleep quantity and quality are synthesized. Second, the mechanisms through which social media use disrupts sleep, namely that 1) social media use displaces time spent sleeping, 2) that the content on social media is stimulating, and 3) that the blue light emitted by digital devices suppresses the production of melatonin, decreasing sleepiness are discussed. Third, the research designs and methods that were employed are explored. Fourth, future research directions are proposed. Finally, tips to improve sleep in the digital age are provided.

AB  - Media use could be detrimental to children's language and literacy skills because it may displace other language-enhancing activities like shared reading and caregiver-child interactions. Furthermore, the extent to which children use media with adults (joint media engagement), the extent to which they use interactive media (apps/games), and the time of the day and week during which media use occurs may attenuate any negative effects. The current study examines the relation between characteristics of children's media use and gains in first graders' language and literacy skills. Children (N = 488) completed direct assessments of language and literacy skills in the spring of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. Parents reported how many hours children used both interactive and non-interactive media during different times of the day on the most recent weekday and weekend day and responded to items about the extent to which they engage with their children during media use. A quadratic relationship between media use and language gains showed that a moderate amount of media use was related to larger language gains, whereas high use was related to smaller gains. For literacy, an interaction between media use and joint media engagement showed a small negative effect of media use at low levels of joint media engagement and little to no relation between media use and literacy gains at higher levels of joint media engagement. Children's language and literacy skills were not predicted by either the proportion of media time that was spent with apps/games or morning and weekday media use. These results show that moderate amounts of media use may not be a negative influence on children's developing language skills, whereas high levels may displace other language-enhancing activities. Additionally, joint media engagement may play an important buffering role in the relation between media use and early literacy skills, aligned with current recommendations encouraging co-viewing.

AB  - Media use is a pervasive aspect of children's home experiences but is often not considered in studies of the home learning environment. Media use could be detrimental to children's language and literacy skills because it may displace other literacy-enhancing activities like shared reading and decrease the quantity and quality of caregiver-child interaction. Thus, the current study asked whether media use is associated with gains in children's language and literacy skills both at a single time point and across a school year and whether age moderates any association. Children (N = 1583) were from preschool through third grade classrooms and language and literacy skills were measured in the fall and spring of the school year. Parents reported how much time their child spends using media on a typical school day. Regression analyses showed that using 4 h or more of media was related to lower literacy gains, but not to language gains. Multilevel models conducted as a robustness check showed that this effect did not hold when accounting for classroom. In neither set of models was there an interaction between age and media use. Single-time-point models did show some associations that did not manifest in more stringent models, highlighting the limitations of correlational designs that do not have measures of children's skills over time. Given the concern and popular press coverage around children's media use, it is important to acknowledge non-significant effects in this domain. These non-significant associations suggest that societal fears around children's media use may be exaggerated. Notably, however, characteristics of children's media use, like educational content or adult co-use, may moderate any effects. The relation between media use and language and literacy growth did not differ across the age range investigated suggesting that, within this range, younger children are not more vulnerable to detrimental effects.

T2  - Technology and adolescent health: In schools and beyond.
AB  - Media, technology and screens have undoubtedly revolutionized daily life, and in many aspects, for the better. However, they have had tremendous adverse impacts on sleep in our adolescents, whose biological sleep schedules are already at odds with societal expectations. This chapter presents a case that illustrates a very common scenario faced by today's adolescents. Naturally occurring shifts in biologic sleep-wake patterns come into conflict with familial/societal expectations, leading to an imposed "jet-lag" for teenagers. The massive increase in media use and ubiquity of screen-based technology used by teens worsens that misalignment. In order to fully understand the impact of screen time on adolescent sleep, the chapter first reviews the physiology of adolescent sleep-wake patterns. It then delves into the impact of screen-based technology on those biologic rhythms, focusing not just on the time displacement away from sleep with screen use, but also on (1) the effects of lights emitted from the screens on circadian rhythm; and (2) the effects of media content on arousal and self-regulation behaviors. Finally, the chapter provides some suggestions on how to mitigate some of the adverse effects of technology use on adolescent sleep. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explored the social repercussions of preadolescents' mobile device use within the family context by testing two opposing predictions regarding the impact of technology on the quality of interpersonal relationships. Specifically, we examined whether smartphone and tablet use was positively related to preadolescents' self-disclosure to their parents and/or displaced family time, which we hypothesized to be related to children's satisfaction with family life. Results of a cross-sectional survey (n = 698, 49.6% girls, Mage = 10.9, SD = 0.69) provided support for both hypotheses, thus corroborating the presence of at least two diverging pathways that underlie this relationship. Although mobile device use seemed to foster a context that supported children's self-disclosure to their parents, results also indicated a negative and indirect association through children's perceived family time. This negative pathway, however, did not hold when social use among children and parents (e.g., playing games together online) was considered separately.

T2  - World Psychiatry
AB  - Social network sites are part of modern life. Worldwide, people spend on average more than two hours on social network sites each day. The massive adoption of social network sites and the many functions they offer may suggest that using them only has benefits. However, the rapid adoption of social network sites has been accompanied with a growing public concern that these sites undermine rather than enhance people's mental health. Initial research, using cross-sectional designs, does not speak to how social network sites impact mental health indicators over time. The authors conducted an experience sampling study, which involved text-messaging participants multiple times per day for several days, asking them to report on their current thoughts, feelings or activities (e.g., use of social network sites). This method is considered the golden standard to measure behavior and emotional experiences over time within the context of everyday life. Using this approach, they demonstrated that Facebook use predicts declines in mental health over time. Future research, examining subcategories of active and passive use, as well as research on additional explanatory psychological processes (e.g., distraction, multi-tasking, information overload, and social displacement) is needed to further refine our understanding of the impact of social network sites on mental health.

AB  - The article briefs about the difficulties faced by dual-earner families in urban India. Dual-earner families are those in which both spouses are employed in full-time employment outside homes. Data tells that 20.1% of urban households in India have dual-earning members. Due to heavy work pressures requiring them to remain connected to digital devices always, urban dual-earning parents, of whom mothers in particular, remained distant and disconnected from their children. This displacement of the parent-child relationship due to parents' over-attachment to digital devices is the foundational premise of the connected-disconnected condition. If unchecked, it could worsen, leading to negative consequences for both parents and children's wellbeing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research has focused on identifying addiction to social media, as it has become a major concern. Of the college students included in the current study, about 50% of them perceived themselves as addicted to social media between 75%-100% and about 20% of them perceived themselves as addicted to social media 100%. Moreover, the current study was the first to investigate if each item of a nine-item Social Media Disorder scale (preoccupation, tolerance, withdrawal, persistence, escape, problems, deception, displacement, and conflict) predicted perceived social media addiction. A stepwise regression analysis was utilized with a significance level of 0.001 to predict the perceived social media addiction as a function of the nine-item Social Media Disorder scale, followed by a hierarchical regression for confirmation. Among the nine-items of the Social Media Disorder Scale, withdrawal and persistence significantly contributed to the model. Specifically, withdrawal predicted 10.2% of perceived social media addiction, while persistence predicted 5.9% of perceived social media addiction.

AB  - Public and scholarly debate about the effects of media on youth has been a topic of concern since the twentieth century. These concerns were further amplified and accelerated with heavy use of and reliance on media for everyday living and learning with the homebound conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the public discourse about children's media use and school safety concerns, we conducted online interviews of 36 young people ages 9-14 years to learn about (1) their life situations, including school experience, (2) their overall media use, (3) their overall worries and difficulty with their situations, and (4) their stress management and coping strategies during the fall semester of 2020. While tweens reported using media more during the pandemic than before, media did not seem to completely displace other activities. Tweens engaged in media, non-media, and hybrid coping strategies to relieve stress, enhance their mood, and stay connected to others outside their home. This qualitative study was a first step in understanding the effect of COVID-19 on tweens within the context of their coping and resiliency building, and how media factor into these processes.

T2  - British Journal of Developmental Psychology
AB  - This study aimed to analyse the contribution of mothers' home literacy beliefs and practices and the quantity and quality of screen media exposure on Argentinean toddler's language. In addition, we considered parent-child joint engagement, as well as adult scaffolding behaviours during the use of electronic devices. A total of 465 mothers of 18-36 months old children completed an online survey including: the MacArthur Bates CDI, home literacy, screen exposure, joint engagement and scaffolding questionnaires. We observed positive effects of literacy beliefs, PC times and verbal scaffolding on language outcomes. TV exposure contributed negatively to vocabulary and, along with educational content, to sentence use. Shared reading and screen media experiences can be an opportunity for language stimulation, provided there is dialogue and joint engagement. Passive screen exposure and inadequate content may be detrimental for toddlers' language outcomes, probably by displacement of socially significant interactions.

AU  - Danielsbacka, Mirkka

T2  - Journal of Family Studies
AB  - A salient question in the digital era is whether new forms of digital communication (e.g. instant messages, video calls, e-mails) have displaced or reinforced more traditional forms of communication (e.g. meeting face-to-face, contact by phone, sending letters/postcards). These opposing hypotheses, i.e. digital communication as a reinforcer versus a displacer, have attracted abundant attention among scholars; however, studies have scarcely explored these hypotheses in the context of communication among kin. Using large-scale and population-based data of 1,945 young to middle-aged (18-55 year-olds) and 2,663 older (68-73 year-olds) Finns, we tested the predictions derived from the displacement and reinforcement hypotheses in several kin dyads (parent-child, grandparent-grandchild, siblings, and aunt/uncle-niece/nephew). The results supported the reinforcement hypothesis in all kin dyads, and in both younger and older adults. Associations between digital and traditional communication were positive even after controlling for a wide range of potentially confounding factors. Hence, it can be concluded that digital means reinforce rather than displace traditional forms of contact. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Drug and Alcohol Review
AB  - Introduction: Qualitative research aimed at understanding the decline in youth drinking has so far been hampered by a lack of baseline data for comparison. This New Zealand study overcomes this limitation by comparing archival qualitative data collected at the height of youth drinking (1999-2001) with contemporary data collected for this study (June-October 2022). The aim is to explore changes in the function and social meaning of alcohol use (and non-use) for two cohorts about 20 years apart. Methods: Both archival and contemporary data were collected from 14 to 17 year old secondary school students (years 10-12) through individual and small-group/pair interviews in matched suburban co-ed schools. Interviews explored friendships, lifestyles, romantic relationships and experiences and perceptions of substance use and non-use. Results and Discussion: Comparative analysis highlighted changes that may help to explain the decline in youth drinking, including an increased value placed on personal choice and acceptance of diversity; decreased face-to-face socialising and the emergence of social media as a central feature of adolescent social life, perhaps displacing key functions of drinking and partying; increased pervasiveness of risk discourses and increased awareness of health and social risks of alcohol; and increased framing of alcohol use as a coping mechanism by both drinkers and non-drinkers. Conclusions: Collectively, these changes appear to have shifted the social position of drinking from an almost compulsory component of adolescent social life in 1999-2001, to an optional activity that many contemporary adolescents perceive to have high risks and few benefits.

AB  - This study aimed to examine developmental relations of screen time, negative affect and effortful control in children aged 12-36 months. Parents of 462 children up to 3 years of age at the start of the study (M = 1.28 years, SD = 0.61; 50% female) participated in four assessments within 10 months. Parents reported their children's screen time, negative affect, and effortful control at each assessment in a diary study. Results of multivariate Bayesian multilevel growth modeling revealed correlations between growth parameters of (1) children's screen time and their negative affect and (2) children's negative affect and their effortful control but not between growth parameters of (3) children's screen time and their effortful control. Overall, these results indicate that children's screen time may be associated with their negative affect independently of their effortful control. Hence, we found no evidence of displacement in the development of self-regulatory strategies in children of parents with higher levels of education. Future research on this topic should focus on children's excessive screen media use, considering contextual and content-related screen media factors and other factors in the child's immediate and broader environment.

AU  - Page Jeffery, Catherine
T2  - Journal of Children and Media
AB  - Networked technologies and device use have become a significant source of conflict between parents and their children, negatively affecting family cohesion and wellbeing. Drawing on the findings of a participatory action research project which consisted of family workshops designed to discuss, and ultimately reduce, family digital conflict, this article explores the main sources of digital conflict amongst Australian families. Four main causes of digital conflict were reported by parents and their children: the amount of time that young people spend online and the subsequent displacement of other tasks considered by parents as more worthwhile; "inappropriate" content; the perceived effects of digital media use on children's behaviour, and sibling conflict. Findings also revealed differing perspectives and knowledges about the value of digital technologies between parents and children which contributed to family conflict. The findings point towards a greater need for interventions which facilitate a more democratic approach to digital parenting, premised upon parental listening, negotiation, and mutual understanding.

AB  - Digital disconnection has emerged as a concept describing the actions people take to limit their digital connectivity to enhance their well-being. To date, evidence on its effectiveness is mixed, leading to calls for greater consideration of why, how, when, and for whom digital disconnection works. This article responds to these calls, presenting a framework that differentiates four key harms that contribute to experiences of digital ill-being (time displacement, interference, role blurring, and exposure effects). Using these four harms as a starting point, the framework explains: (1) why people are motivated to digitally disconnect; (2) how specific disconnection strategies (i.e., placing limits on time, access, channels, and contents, interactions and features) may help them; and for whom (3) and under which conditions (when) these strategies can be effective.

T2  - Current Treatment Options in Psychiatry
AB  - Purpose of Review: The effect of social media use on youth mental health is a primary public concern. Despite extensive research on the topic, social media use's impact on adolescent mental health remains unclear with study results often contradicting each other. This narrative review examines recent literature on the relationship between social media use and youth mental health, highlights disparities in study results, and offers a novel approach for future research. Recent Findings: Three conclusions were drawn from our review. First, contrasting usage patterns may affect mental health outcomes. Second, social media use may impact social comparison, social displacement, social stimulation, and self-determination. Lastly, limits in research methodology inhibit our understanding of the relationship between screen time and youth mental health outcomes due to the over-reliance on self-report scales, heterogeneity in scale usage, and problematic analysis methods. Summary: The complexity of understanding the impact of social media use on youth mental health should not deter research. To advance methodology and elucidate outcomes, future studies should utilize the digital phenotyping approach. This approach uses objective data assessment from personal digital devices and allows researchers to better analyze the impact of social media use on youth mental health.

T2  - Marketing Science
AB  - An ongoing debate among firms, rightsholders, particularly in the music industry, and policymakers in the United States and the European Union concerns potential changes to the regulation of user-generated content (UGC) video streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube). Currently, safe harbor provisions protect platforms from liability for copyright-infringing content uploaded by users, and requirements for compensating rightsholders for UGC are weak, resulting in comparatively low payouts. At the same time, it is unclear how a change in these regulations would affect consumer demand for this content on other platforms with higher payouts (e.g., Spotify), that is, whether UGC platforms stimulate or displace demand on other platforms. We study a quasi-experiment that occurred when numerous songs became available as UGC on YouTube after an agreement between YouTube and the German royalty collecting society. Our analysis of an unprecedented data set covering 600,000 songs by 38,000 artists reveals an intriguing finding: Although UGC availability stimulates demand in other streaming channels for most songs, cannibalization occurs for recent releases and hit releases, turning the overall revenue effect negative. We discuss how policymakers can use these findings to understand the implications of changes in regulation, and how labels and artists can decide which content to block or allow on UGC platforms.

AB  - Significant changes to daily life and educational routines due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in social interactions and might have contributed to an increase in screen-based activities, loneliness, and mental health issues among adolescents. Two years after the pandemic outbreak, the present study examined the relationships between time spent using digital technology (DT), loneliness and well-being among three cohorts of adolescents in Croatia. A moderated mediation model of relationship between time spent using DT and well-being was tested, with loneliness as a potential mediator and gender as a moderator. A nationally representative sample included 370611-year-olds, 3866 13-year-olds and 8815 17-year-olds. The study was conducted in lower and upper secondary schools in the spring of 2022. The questionnaire contained a single item self-report measure of time spent using DT and loneliness, while the adapted WHO-5 was used for measuring adolescents' well-being. Results indicated that time spent using DT was positively associated with loneliness and negatively associated with well-being. Loneliness mediated the relationship between time spent using DT and well-being in all cohorts. This mediation was moderated by gender in the group of 11-year-olds only. Gender moderated the direct effect on well-being among 11- and 13-year-olds. Effects were stronger among girls and younger participants. The results are discussed in light of the displacement hypothesis, which posits that negative effects on well-being are a consequence of the replacement of in-person activities with screen-based activities.

AB  - The displacement of sports and other physical activities by television and video may contribute to the associations among television viewing, obesity, and reduced physical fitness. Because video games are widely played by children and adolescents, we assessed the metabolic and cardiovascular responses to video game playing. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen consumption were measured serially over 30 minutes in 32 males and females aged 16 to 25 years (mean +/- SEM, 20 +/- 1 years) while they played the ''Ms Pacman'' video game under standard laboratory conditions and compared with measurements made in a standing but inactive position. Playing the video game significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and oxygen consumption. Energy expenditure increased from 6.08 +/- 0.24 kJ/min while the subjects stood inactive to 10.94 +/- 0.49 kJ/min while they played. The increase in metabolic rate and cardiovascular stimulation was similar in magnitude to mild-intensity exercise.

T2  - Journal of Social and Personal Relationships
AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT) facilitates communication within families but may also displace face-to-face communication and intimacy. The aims of this systematic review were to investigate what positive and negative relationship outcomes are associated with ICT use in families, and whether and how the outcomes differ depending on relationship type (romantic relationship, parent-child relationship, or sibling). Included in the review were research published in English between 2009 and 2019 studying the effects of ICT on family relationships with quantitative data. 70 peer-reviewed articles (73 studies) were retrieved and categorized based on four types of ICT variables: personal use, personal use in the presence of a family member (technoference), communication between family members, and co-use with family members. Personal use and technoference were mostly related to negative outcomes due to, for example, displaced attention and more frequent conflicts. Romantic partners were especially strongly negatively affected displaying stressors unique to romantic relationships, such as infidelity. By contrast, communication and co-use showed mostly positive effects across all relationship types. In particular, "rich" communication media resembling face-to-face interaction were strongly associated with positive outcomes. We conclude that ICT impacts family relations in different ways, depending on both the type of relationship and type of ICT use. Personal ICT use tends to weaken both parenting and romantic relationships in ways that can partly be mitigated by co-use and communication. Directions for future research include, assessing how often ICT is used in relationship-strengthening versus relationship-interfering ways, investigating causal pathways between ICT use and relationship quality, and focusing on understudied relationship types, such as siblings and grandparents.

AB  - Time-use diaries were collected over a 3-year period for 2 cohorts of 2- and 4-year-old children. TV viewing declined with age. Time spent in reading and educational activities increased with age on weekdays but declined on weekends. Time-use patterns were sex-stereotyped, and sex differences increased with age. As individuals' time in educational activities, social interaction, and video games increased, their time watching entertainment TV declined, but time spent playing covaried positively with entertainment TV. Educational TV viewing was not related to time spent in non-TV activities. Maternal education and home environment quality predicted frequent viewing of educational TV programs and infrequent viewing of entertainment TV. The results do not support a simple displacement hypothesis; the relations of TV viewing to other activities depend on the program content, the nature of the competing activity, and the environmental context.

AB  - In this Monograph, we report the follow-up of 570 adolescents who had been studied as preschoolers in one of two separate investigations of television use. The primary goal of the study was to determine the long-term relations between preschool television viewing and adolescent achievement, behavior, and attitudes. Using a telephone interview and high school transcripts, we assessed adolescent media use; grades in English, science, and math; leisure reading; creativity; aggression; participation in extracurricular activities; use of alcohol and cigarettes; and self-image. In each domain, we tested theories emphasizing the causal role of television content (e.g., social learning, information processing) as contrasted with those theories positing effects of television as a medium, irrespective of content (e.g., time displacement, pacing, interference with language). The results provided much stronger support for content-based hypotheses than for theories emphasizing television as a medium; moreover, the patterns differed for boys and girls. Viewing educational programs as preschoolers was associated with higher grades, reading more books, placing more value on achievement, greater creativity, and less aggression. These associations were more consistent for boys than for girls. By contrast, the girls who were more frequent preschool viewers of violent programs had lower grades than those who were infrequent viewers. These associations held true after taking into account family background, other categories of preschool viewing, and adolescent media use. One hypothesis accounting for the sex differences is that early experiences, such as television viewing, have greater effects when they counteract normative developmental trends and predominant sex-typed socialization influences than when they reinforce them. Adolescents in the study used both television and print media to support ongoing interests. Television content (e.g., entertainment, sports, or world events) predicted extracurricular activities, role models, and body image. The only evidence for possible effects of television as a medium was the positive relation of total viewing to obesity for girls. The medium of television is not homogeneous or monolithic, and content viewed is more important than raw amount. The medium is not the message: The message is.

TI  - Television viewing and childhood obesity
AU  - Robinson T.N.
T2  - Pediatric Clinics of North America
AB  - Children spend a substantial portion of their lives watching television. Investigators have hypothesized that television viewing causes obesity by one or more of three mechanisms: (1) displacement of physical activity, (2) increased calorie consumption while watching or caused by the effects of advertising, and (3) reduced resting metabolism. The relationship between television viewing and obesity has been examined in a relatively large number of cross-sectional epidemiologic studies but few longitudinal studies. Many of these studies have found relatively weak, positive associations, but others have found no associations or mixed results; however, the weak and variable associations found in these studies may be the result of limitations in measurement. Several experimental studies of reducing television viewing recently have been completed. Most of these studies have not tested directly the effects of reducing television viewing behaviors alone, but their results support the suggestion that reducing television viewing may help to reduce the risk for obesity or help promote weight loss in obese children. Finally, one school-based, experimental study was designed specifically to test directly the causal relationship between television viewing behaviors and body fatness. The results of this randomized, controlled trial provide evidence that television viewing is a cause of increased body fatness and that reducing television viewing is a promising strategy for preventing childhood obesity.

AB  - There is growing concern over the effects of sedentary lifestyles on the health of young people. Recent rapid increases in juvenile obesity have received a great deal of attention in the scientific and popular press and have been attributed partly to television viewing, computer games and other sedentary behaviours. These are thought to compete with physical activity. There is a 'moral panic' concerning the 'couch kids' culture in modern western society. Project STIL (Sedentary Teenagers and Inactive Lifestyles) at Loughborough University is investigating 'what young people do' and focuses on active and inactive pursuits chosen in their leisure time. The following issues are addressed in this paper with specific reference to young people: how do we define 'sedentary behaviour' and do key sedentary behaviours displace physical activity? Are key sedentary behaviours obesogenic? What are the secular trends for children and youth for TV viewing? Our results for young people suggest that: 1. TV viewing and video-game playing are largely uncorrelated with physical activity, suggesting that there is time for both 2. meta-analytic findings show that body fatness is not related in any clinically meaningful way with key sedentary behaviours 3. although more children and youth have greater access to TVs than in previous generations, the amount of TV watched per head has not changed for 40 years. Preliminary findings from Project STIL suggest that inactivity is more complex than we sometimes think. Indeed, measures of 'couch potato-ism', such as TV viewing, may be inappropriate markers of inactivity.

AU  - Pagani L.S.

T2  - Paediatrics and Child Health
AB  - In recent decades, there has been a dramatic increase in unhealthy weight for both children and adults. The Canadian standard of living has changed in favour of more easily prepared, calorie-dense foods and sedentary practices. Many family characteristics have also changed over the past 50 years. More Canadian families are living in disadvantaged situations, forecasting a host of unhealthy behaviours and attitudes in adults. The poor are not only getting poorer, they are also becoming heavier. Children from disadvantaged families seem to be leading the trend in increasing prevalence of unhealthy weight. Because they live in neighbourhoods that are perceived as unsafe, these children are likely spending more time indoors. This is associated with watching more television, which not only displaces other forms of educational and active entertainment but also places them at risk of learning inaccurate information about proper eating. Social science research helps identify factors contributing most to the rise in excess weight within this population, thus providing essential clues for effective approaches to its eradication. ©2007 Pulsus Group Inc.

AU  - Williams D.
T2  - Cyberpsychology and Behavior
AB  - Hypotheses and research questions about the Internet displacing social capital, atomizing users, creating loneliness, and creating new forms of community were addressed through an original survey of Internet users. A key innovation of this research is that it collects parallel measures of social capital for online and offline contexts, which can then be compared. The results show that while Internet use does suggest a displacing effect, it is also a source of new, qualitatively different social capital. However, there is no connection between Internet use and atomization (or out-group antagonism), and the latter is actually lower online. Taken together, the results suggest that the Internet is no panacea but is not a direct source of problems either. More likely is the case that the costs and benefits for individuals will be predicted by their personalities and particular kinds of Internet use. The results are discussed, along with their implications for theory and future research. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

T2  - Annals of Behavioral Medicine
AB  - Physical inactivity contributes to premature mortality and morbidity and increasing prevalences of overweight and obesity in industrialized countries. Computer use is an increasingly common sedentary behaviour, potentially displacing physical activity. Physical activity and computer use were examined in 697 young adults (18-30 years). Energy expenditure estimates were derived from self-reported walking, moderate, and vigorous activity; participants were classified as sedentary, low, moderate, or high in their level of activity. For multivariate analyses, two categories of physical activity were used: inactive (sedentary/low activity; <800 kcal . week-1) or active (moderate/high activity; >=800 kcal . week-1). Time spent in computer-related activities was summed, and computer use tertiles calculated (<3 hours . week-1; 3-8 hours . week-1; >8 hours . week-1). Those in the highest tertile of computer use were most likely to be inactive (p = 0.003) and most likely to report computer use as a barrier to physical activity (p < 0.001). The majority of those in the top two tertiles of computer use, and of the inactive, preferred obtaining information from computers than from conventional print media. These findings suggest that computer use plays a significant role in the discretionary time of young adults and is negatively associated with physical activity. Computer-mediated communication has potential in disseminating interventions to increase physical activity in young adults.

TI  - Net-generation attributes and seductive properties of the internet as predictors of online activities and internet addiction
AU  - Leung L.
T2  - Cyberpsychology and Behavior
AB  - Born between 1977 and 1997, Net-generation is the first generation to grow up surrounded by home computers, video games, and the Internet. As children of the Baby Boomers, the Internet is the medium of choice for the Net-geners. Based on the assumption that Net-generation has unique characteristics, this study examined (1) how Net-geners addicted to the Internet differ from the non-addicted and (2) how these attributes, together with the seductive properties of the Internet, are related to Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a probability sample of 699 Net-geners between the ages of 16 and 24. Results show that Net-geners addicted to the Internet tend to be young female students. Being emotionally open on the Net and a heavy user of ICQ were most influential in predicting Net-geners' problematic use of the Internet. Addicted Net-geners are also strongly linked to the pleasure of being able to control the simulated world in online games. The finding reinforces previous research that "dependents" of the Internet spend most of their time in the synchronous communication environment engaging in interactive online games, chat rooms, and ICQ for pleasure-seeking or escape, while "non- dependents" use information-gathering functions available on the Internet. Furthermore, Internet addicts tend to watch television significantly less, indicating a displacement effect on traditional media use for the Net-generation.

TI  - Media literacy for clinicians and parents
AU  - Villani V.S.
AU  - Olson C.K.
AU  - Jellinek M.S.
T2  - Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America
AB  - Media literacy is a young field that has evolved over the last two decades in response to growing concern about how mass media affect children. This article has outlined an approach for clinicians and parents that is highly individualized and family based. Larger school-based approaches logically would have some appeal, but actual research in this area is scant. One randomized, controlled school-based study used a 6-month, 18-lesson curriculum to encourage second- and third-grade children to monitor and limit their media use and be "intelligent viewers" [82,83]. As a group, the intervention school students were found to have reduced their television use and perhaps videotape and video game use (parent and child reports differed or changes were nonsignificant); they also showed reductions in some measures of aggression at post-test relative to controls (peer-rated aggression and verbal aggression observed on the school playground). Other measures showed no significant changes, however. Because results were reported at the school level, it is hard to know what might have accounted for any changes at the individual level (eg, amount of exposure to the curriculum, changes in use of various media, or parent education about media use). The content of television programs, videos, and video games was not assessed. Influencing choices about media content may be as important as limiting amount of media consumption, except when it comes to physical health, weight gain, and displacement of healthier activities. The Robinson study looked for effects of media consumption on weight and found that reducing meals eaten in front of the television and time sitting watching television promoted a healthier body weight. Future studies might provide useful insights for parents and health professionals on the relative influence of school-based and parent education on media literacy and changes in media choices and home routines. Differing definitions, perspectives, and methodologies add to the challenge of translating existing media research into advice on which parents can act. The availability, content, and interactivity of media are evolving so fast that research conducted even a few years ago may offer little guidance. We also know little about how the dose of media, context of media use, and children's temperament, experiences, and relationships might mediate any positive or negative effects. We can, however, draw some comfort from the knowledge that children are influenced overwhelmingly by the values and behavior of their parents (and how they are treated by others, especially caregivers and teachers). In general, children are resilient and have an amazing capacity to adapt to the world. Parents, as they do for many areas of a child's life, must assess their own values and experiences, listen to various experts, and then guide children toward productive autonomy. On a societal level, concerns about media's influence - especially on violence and social isolation - can be mitigated by addressing issues known to affect children's healthy development, such as day care, educational opportunities, after-school activities, adequate health care, access to mental health services, and protection from violence in the home. Efforts to give parents and families more time together and provide high-quality care for children when parents are absent are the positive supports that will help children and families cope with rapid cultural change. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Media use as a reason for meal skipping and fast eating in secondary school children
AU  - Van den Bulck J.
AU  - Eggermont S.
T2  - Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics
AB  - Objective: This study examined self-reported meal skipping and faster than usual with the goal of watching television or playing computer games. Method(s): Respondents reported their media use and indicated how often they skipped a meal to watch a favourite television programme or to play a computer game, and how often they ate faster than usual in order to watch television or play a computer game. Subjects: Respondents were 2546 adolescents of 13 (first year of secondary school) and 16 years (fourth year of secondary school) of age. Result(s): About one respondent in 10 skipped at least one meal every week for either television viewing or computer game playing. Weekly meal skipping for television viewing occurs more regularly in boys and first-year students, but particularly in teenagers who view 5 h or more daily (15% of the sample). The category of teenagers who play computer games four times a week or more (25.3% of the sample) is at increased risk of meal skipping; those who play more than four times a week are 10 times more likely weekly to skip a meal. A quarter of the adolescents eat faster at least once a week to be able to watch television or play a computer game. Regardless of gender and school year, teenagers' risk of eating faster progressively increases with their use of the media. Those who watch 4 h or more daily are about seven times more likely to skip a meal for television and those who play computer games at least four times a week are nine times more likely weekly to skip a meal. Conclusion(s): Unhealthy eating habits can be a side effect of heavy or excessive media use. Teenagers' use of television or game computers during nonworking or out-of-school hours partly displaces the amount of time that needs to be spent at meals. Practitioners and educators may try to encourage or restore a pattern of healthful meal consumption habits by reducing the amount of media use, and by supporting parental rule-making regarding children's eating habits and media use. © The British Dietetic Association Ltd 2006.

AB  - Background: Television viewing is hypothesized to contribute to obesity among children and adolescents through several mechanisms that include the displacement of physical activity, snacking while watching TV, and the influence of food advertising. Method(s): This study drew on television ratings to examine the distribution of food advertising exposure among adolescents aged 12 through 17 based on 170 top-rated shows across network, cable and syndicated TV stations over the 9-month period from September 2003 to May 2004. A total of 238,353 30-second equivalent advertisements on the top-rated shows were assessed. Each advertisement was weighted by its rating to measure actual exposure to advertisements. Result(s): The results showed that among total nonprogram content time, food-related products accounted for roughly one fifth of advertising exposure. Excluding TV promotions and public service announcements, as a proportion of all product advertising, total food-related advertising made up 26% of advertised products viewed by adolescents. By race, the proportion of advertising exposure to food products was 14% greater for African-American versus white adolescents and total exposure to food advertising would be even larger for African-American teens given that, on average, they watched more TV. Fast food was the most frequently viewed food product category comprising 23% of all food-related advertisements among adolescents. Conclusion(s): Food ads made up just over one quarter of TV ads viewed by adolescents with the most commonly viewed products of fast food, sweets, and beverage products well within the reach of their own purchasing power. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

TI  - Television viewing: Moderator or mediator of an adolescent physical activity intervention?

AU  - Schneider M.

T2  - American Journal of Health Promotion
AB  - Purpose. To determine whether the amount of television (TV) watched by participants enrolled in a physical activity intervention mediates or moderates program effectiveness. Design. Nine-month, controlled, school-based physical activity intervention. Setting. Public high school. Participants. One hundred twenty-two sedentary adolescent females (mean +/- standard deviation age = 15.04 +/- 0.79 years). Intervention. Supervised in-class exercise, health education, and internet-based self-monitoring. Measures. Physical activity by 3-day physical activity recall; TV viewing by self-reports; cardiovascular fitness by cycle ergometer. Analysis. T-tests were conducted to examine between-group differences. Linear regression equations tested the mediating or moderating role of TV watching relative to the intervention. Results. TV viewing moderated the intervention 's effect on vigorous activity; the intervention significantly predicted change in physical activity among high (beta = -.45; p < .001), but not among low (p > .05), TV watchers. TV viewing did not mediate the intervention effect. Conclusions. Consistent with displacement theory, adolescents who watched more TV prior to the intervention showed postintervention increases in vigorous physical activity and concomitant decreases in TV viewing, whereas those who watched less TV showed no change in physical activity or TV viewing.

AU  - Weis R.

T2  - Psychological Science
AB  - Young boys who did not own video games were promised a video-game system and child-appropriate games in exchange for participating in an "ongoing study of child development." After baseline assessment of boys' academic achievement and parentand teacher-reported behavior, boys were randomly assigned to receive the video-game system immediately or to receive the video-game system after follow-up assessment, 4 months later. Boys who received the system immediately spent more time playing video games and less time engaged in after-school academic activities than comparison children. Boys who received the system immediately also had lower reading and writing scores and greater teacher-reported academic problems at follow-up than comparison children. Amount of video-game play mediated the relationship between video-game ownership and academic outcomes. Results provide experimental evidence that video games may displace after-school activities that have educational value and may interfere with the development of reading and writing skills in some children. © The Author(s) 2010.

TI  - What physicians should know about the effects of media on infants
AU  - Christakis D.A.
T2  - Acta Paediatrica, International Journal of Paediatrics
AB  - Introduction: In 1970, the average age at which children began to watch television was 4 years. Today it is 4 months. Most of this shift has occurred within the past 10 years. Over 90% of children begin using media as infants and the typical infant spends 2-3 h per day watching TV. Those in certain day care settings may spend an additional 1-2 h/day viewing. Purpose(s): The speaker has been studying the effects of infant TV viewing on behavioral and cognitive outcomes for 10 years. His operating hypothesis is that TV exposure during this critical period of brain development has direct and indirect effects on infants' development mediated both through overstimulation and through displacement of other activities. Method(s): This talk will present data from a series of cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies of infant TV viewing and language development and attentional capacity. In addition, preliminary results from mouse models of infant TV exposure will be summarized. Result(s): Infant TV viewing - particularly faster paced shows - is associated with shorter attention spans at school entry as well as delayed language acquisition in infants 7- 16 months of age. Specifically, each hour of TV viewing is associated with infants knowing about seven fewer words and a 10% increased risk of subsequent attentional problems. Furthermore, when infants are within ear shot of a TV they speak less and are spoken to less by adult caregivers. Conclusion(s): Despite claims made to the contrary, there is no evidence of benefit of infant media usage. The best available data suggest the real potential for harm. Media usage during infancy should be avoided.

AB  - The present study examined physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns of adolescents between 15.30h and 18.30h. The sample for this study is 1,484 (boys: n = 561; girls: n = 923). Boys and girls reported 21 and 19 min of physical activity and 24 and 26 min of homework respectively during this period. Technology-based sedentary behavior (TV viewing, computer and video game use) was significantly higher in boys than girls (boys = 50 mins; girls = 35 mins; p < .05). The most prevalent behaviors after school are technology-based sedentary behavior, homework and physical activity. During these hours, engagement in physical activity does not appear to displace time spent doing homework. © 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.

TI  - Trends in media use
AU  - Roberts D.F.
AU  - Foehr U.G.
T2  - Future of Children
AB  - American youth are awash in media. They have television sets in their bedrooms, personal computers in their family rooms, and digital music players and cell phones in their backpacks. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping, with the average American eight- to eighteen-year-old reporting more than six hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of "media multitasking" - using several media concurrently - multiplies that figure to eight and a half hours of media exposure daily. Donald Roberts and Ulla Foehr examine how both media use and media exposure vary with demographic factors such as age, race and ethnicity, and household socioeconomic status, and with psychosocial variables such as academic performance and personal adjustment. They note that media exposure begins early, increases until children begin school, drops off briefly, then climbs again to peak at almost eight hours daily among eleven- and twelve-year-olds. Television and video exposure is particularly high among African American youth. Media exposure is negatively related to indicators of socioeconomic status, but that relationship may be diminishing. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance. Roberts and Foehr also review evidence pointing to the existence of a digital divide - variations in access to personal computers and allied technologies by socioeconomic status and by race and ethnicity. The authors also examine how the recent emergence of digital media such as personal computers, video game consoles, and portable music players, as well as the media multitasking phenomenon they facilitate, has increased young people's exposure to media messages while leaving media use time largely unchanged. Newer media, they point out, are not displacing older media but are being used in concert with them. The authors note which young people are more or less likely to use several media concurrently and which media are more or less likely to be paired with various other media. They argue that one implication of such media multitasking is the need to reconceptualize "media exposure.".

TI  - Digital Acculturation or Displacement?: Examining the Link Between Social Media and Well-Being
AU  - Guan, SSA
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN DYNAMICS
AB  - The current study applies digital media and acculturation models to assess the links between offline social connection, online social media use, and well-being. Acculturation research suggests that intercultural contact can create conflict that individuals must resolve using four acculturations strategies: marginalization, separation, assimilation, or integration. It suggests that those who fare best adopt strategies in which they maintain heritage connection, identity and values [e.g., offline, face-to-face (F2F) social connection] while also connecting with people and norms in the new context (i.e., online). The social interaction displacement hypothesis suggests that high media use that displaces in-person social interaction (i.e., assimilation strategy) can lead to poor outcomes. The results from a survey of 60 college students (Mage = 22.02, SD = 3.54; 73.3% female) suggest that individuals who maintain high offline, F2F social interaction (i.e., separation strategy) fared better than those who adopted assimilation or even integrations strategies. The findings have implications for people who spend more time online, perhaps at the expense of in-person socialization, and introduce novel opportunities for the understanding of the link between social media and poor mental health outcomes.

AB  - The increasing diffusion of smart speakers results in substantial challenges for news publishers. Voice-based formats - especially news podcasts - gain significant importance via smart speakers, raising the question of displacement effects on other news media. We investigate the interplay of smart speakers and podcasts with news consumption data from 1,528 respondents collected in Germany. We control for selection effects using propensity score matching and find (I) a higher usage of news podcasts as well as (II) higher podcast news consumption intensity, both driven by smart speaker diffusion. Additionally, podcast usage increases the total cross-media news consumption intensity without displacing other media. We provide converging evidence that smart speakers are a relevant complementary news content channel to access podcasts, which subsequently contribute to strengthening news consumption through other media.

Findings from a national sample in Hong Kong, which has among the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the world, found support for all perspectives. Those in the 18-34 and 35-54 cohorts were mostly multiplatform users of news, yet subgroup analyses reveal different patterns of complementary uses and displacement. Moreover, results showed that different gratifications predict mobile hard news use and mobile soft news use. Implications and future prospects for mobile news are discussed.

TI  - Young adults' perceptions of the relevance of interaction on social online networks for sports activities
AU  - Braumüller, B
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR SPORT AND SOCIETY
AB  - In our mediatised world, social media has become increasingly important as a distinct environment for facilitating juvenile developmental tasks, allowing for communication, self-staging, or information seeking. Increasing social media activity is often explicated as displacing participation in sports, although current studies report rather independent or enhancing relations between social media use and sports participation. Online social networks such as Facebook and Instagram constitute a specific social media application and contain a broad variety of sports-related content, ranging from visual representations of sports, sharing of training plans, and recommendations for muscle development, to discussions about sporting equipment. Nevertheless, the impact of these contents on sports activities has been largely neglected in scientific contexts. Against the background of the socialisation theory and uses and gratifications approach, the aim of this study is to analyse the users' perceptions of the relevance of their sports-related interaction on social networks for sports activities from a relativist and constructivist grounding. In qualitative interviews with young adults (n = 10), organisational, motivational, and professionalising implications of interaction on social networks were perceived as relevant for participating in sports. Besides, critical remarks were mentioned, mainly highlighting the lack of transparency, the poor quality of information, and the social pressure to play sports.

AB  - Using time-use data collected in South Korea and the United States, this study examines what Internet users would do if they did not spend time online and whether these activities would include face-to-face social interaction, an important condition for a sense of attachment, physical and psychological health, and social integration. In contrast to most previous studies, we attempt to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity by either using a fixed-effects method or identifying random non-usersInternet users who do not go online on a specific day. Moreover, our cross-cultural comparison helps find more generalisable effects of Internet use. Despite the inconsistent statistical significance in the us and some differences between societies, overall, the results indicate that online time displaces time spent on face-to-face interaction with family and non-family members.

Ninety primary and secondary school students from 6 schools were randomly invited to participate in a one-on-one qualitative semi-structured interview. Mixed responses were received from the students, with regard to whether gaming displaced time with their family and whether it caused conflicts with parents. On a positive note, the majority of them felt that playing games did not displace time with parents or lead to conflicts with parents. This paper presents a detailed account of their perception and reasons on the issue. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AU  - Nikken, P
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB  - Based on a time-lag model, this study tested for changes in young children's (1-6 years) home access and use of digital media in the 2012-2018 period as well as in their parents' views on such media. What it found was that in only a few years the digital devices available to children have become more mobile (tablets and smartphones), more accessible, and more numerous in these children's bedrooms, especially in single-parent households. Also, on average children have strongly increased their daily media use-up to 102 minutes. This is especially true for both younger children (3 years or less, plus 30 minutes) and children in middle to highly educated households (plus 25 minutes). Our findings support the complementary media adoption theory more than the displacement theory. Over the years parents have tended more and more to use digital media as 'babysitters', while they also found it increasingly difficult to stop their children from using such media, which may have major implications for parenting support activities.

AB  - The controversy concerning the future displacement of print media is an ongoing dispute among stakeholders and academic experts. Based on the model of displacement or resilience of a given medium, this study explores the print media audience, primarily by comparing the time spent reading print media with that allotted to consuming their digital equivalents and other media. The study compares nine European democratic countries that have undergone the same technological changes but that also manifest disparate cultures that may explain variance in consumption patterns. The study's main findings demonstrate that print media are still an important component of the new communications environment among European audiences. Reasons for print media's resilience are suggested in the discussion.

AB  - The use of mobile devices facilitates access to knowledge and is at the base of the education of the future. Although the digital society has contributed a number of benefits, it has also been associated with worrying behaviors. The study design consisted of a quantitative approach that was descriptive, inferential and ex post facto in nature. Its purpose was to better understand the opinion of young people regarding smartphone use and describe dependence deriving from regular use. The sample was formed of 420 students from the Faculty of Education at the University of Granada. Results indicate that mobile phone use has displaced use of other technologies such as the television and is associated with communication and recreational activities. In addition, a profile was identified for young people at greater risk of developing a dependence on their mobile devices. This profile constituted female smartphone users with recreational motives and individuals who exceeded mobile phone use by more than six hours a day. To improve the educational use of smartphones, prevention and intervention plans must be designed which ensure correct management of this device, taking advantage of the benefits they offer, while avoiding problems derived from inappropriate use.

AB  - Recently the Swedish Public Health Agency published recommendations of a maximum of two-to-three hours of daily leisure screen time for adolescents aged 13-18, partly to promote better sleep (2024-Sep-02). Biologically and socially, adolescence is characterized by belated sleep times, and depressive effects of screen time can arise through sleep displacements. Theorized links between screen time, sleep, and depression, merited examination of four sleep mediators to determine their relative importance and determine which of them mediate future depression. Hypotheses were preregistered. Three-wave psychometric health data were collected from healthy Swedish students (N = 4810; 51% Boys; ages 12-16; N = 55 schools; n = 20 of 26 Stockholm municipalities). Multiple imputation bias-corrected missing data. Gender-wise Structural Equation Modelling tested four sleep facets as competing mediators (quality, duration, chronotype, social jetlag). The primary model result included the three first mediators to achieve acceptable fit indices (RMSEA = 0.02; SRMR = 0.03; CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.94). Screen time deteriorated sleep within three months and effect sizes varied between mediators (Beta weights ranged: 0.14-0.30) but less between genders. Among boys, screen time at baseline had a direct adverse effect on depression after twelve months (Beta = 0.02; p <0.038). Among girls, the depressive effect was mediated through sleep quality, duration, and chronotype (57, 38, 45% mediation). Social jetlag remained non-significant. This study supports a modernized 'screen-sleep-displacement theory'. It empirically demonstrates that screen-sleep displacements impact several aspects of sleep simultaneously. Displacements led to elevated depressive symptoms among girls but not boys. Boys may be more prone to externalizing symptoms due to sleep loss. Results could mirror potentially beneficial public health effects of national screen time recommendations.

T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - Past research has presented mixed results in regards to the time displacement effects of the computer. In this field experiment, subjects were asked to give up using the computer (except for school work) for one day. The amount of time shift within each traditional medium between the normal day and the non-computer day was examined. The results showed that giving up computer use did not increase time allotted to other media. In addition, no differences in time shifts existed between light and heavy users. Overall, this study provides no support for the claim that using computers takes away time from using traditional media.

AB  - Using survey data on movie consumption by about 500 University of Pennsylvania undergraduate students, we ask whether unpaid consumption of movies displaces paid consumption. A variety of cross-sectional and longitudinal empirical approaches show large and statistically significant evidence of displacement. In the most appropriate empirical specification, we find that unpaid first consumption reduces paid consumption by about 1 unit. Unpaid second consumption has a smaller effect, about 0.20 units. Our analysis indicates that unpaid consumption, which makes up 5.2 per cent of movie viewing in our sample, reduced paid consumption in our sample by 3.5 per cent.

AB  - The virtual access offered by information and communications technology (ICT) has entered homes to an unprecedented degree - with disputed socio-spatial consequences. This paper explores whether people's use of time and space has changed with increasing access to ICT, and it considers the role of the home and the displacement of mobile and stationary activities. Data from the Swedish Time Use Surveys for 1990-1991 and 2000-2001 reveal structural tendencies, while a panel study of urban youth details ongoing change processes. Findings indicate that from 1991 to 2001, the Swedish population spent over 80 per cent more time on virtual mobility; physical travel and media consumption also increased, albeit slightly. The total time spent at home remained stable, though certain groups, young men particularly, significantly increased both time spent at home and ICT use. The panel study found that individuals who substantially increased in-home computer use spent more time alone at home and less time socialising; they also spent less time travelling and watching television. The amount of ICT use adapted to the available free time.

Results from a survey using a proportionate stratified random sample of 883 respondents indicate that the pager was the second major source (after TV) to learn about breaking news events. Further, seeking information and instrumentality were significant predictors for pager use for news, whereas other expected values such as novelty, seeking fun and credibility were not Finally, seeking news via the pager appears to displace viewing of TV news.

AB  - This article reports the findings of a multi-method study that explored whether frequency and duration of parental smartphone use in the presence of children is associated with parents' perceptions of quality time and child restlessness, an indicator of difficult child behavior. Additionally, the study explored whether parental perceptions of technoference, respectively time displacement, mediate the association between smartphone use measures - respectively frequency and duration of use - and the outcome measures. We collected experience sampling and smartphone log data among parents of children aged between 4 and 10 years to assess momentary between- and within-person-level associations between the frequency and duration of co-present parental smartphone use and parents' perceptions of quality time, their child's restlessness, technoference, and time displacement. We gathered 1484 observations from 56 participants. Multilevel mediation analysis revealed no between-person associations between our two measures of parental smartphone use and the outcome measures. At the within-person level, no associations were found with child restlessness. However, smartphone frequency did predict perceptions of greater technoference, and smartphone duration predicted time displacement. Technoference in turn negatively predicted parental experiences, although the hypothesized mediation did not reach statistical significance. Time displacement predicted parental experiences of quality time in the opposite direction of what was hypothesized. Some heterogeneity was found in the observed within-person associations, suggesting that there is person-specificity. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - Previous research has revealed inconsistent findings regarding enhancement or displacement of face-to-face (FtF) communication due to social media and smartphone use. We argue that the occurrence of enhancement or displacement effects is contingent on the specific type of smartphone use. Specifically, we tested how adults' communicative and noncommunicative smartphone uses influence the quantity of FtF communication and quality of relationships with family and friends. Results of a two-wave panel survey (N-Time2 = 461) revealed a positive influence of communicative smartphone use on quantity of FtF communication with family and friends, supporting the enhancement hypothesis. Quality of relationships with close ties, however, was not influenced by communicative smartphone use. In line with the displacement hypothesis, we found a negative influence of noncommunicative smartphone use on quantity of FtF communication with close ties, but not on quality of relationships with family and friends.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS
AB  - Objectives: To quantify the association between high digital engagement at age 17/8 and subsequent depressive symptoms at age 20 adjusting for selection into high digital engagement. To examine the role of social com-parison, displacement and online harassment in mediating the relationship between digital engagement and depressive symptoms.Methods: Using four waves of longitudinal data on the same individuals from the Growing Up in Ireland Cohort98 at ages 9, 13, 17/8 and 20, we apply propensity score methods (PSM) with matching to estimate selection into high digital engagement at age 17/8. Poisson regression is applied to individuals matched according to their propensity to high digital engagement to quantify the role of self-esteem, body weight satisfaction, quality and duration of sleep and online harassment in mediating the association between high digital engagement at 17/8 and depression risk at age 20.Results: Estimates within matched strata suggest a 9.7% increase in depressive symptoms for high digital engagement, over moderate engagement for females. No significant association with high engagement was found for males. Adjustment for self-esteem at 17/8 reduces the association by 26%; adjustment for sleep duration and quality leads to a 23% reduction. Online harassment and body weight satisfaction reduce the association by <2% individually. Our fully adjusted model reduced the association by 41% overall. Conclusions: High digital engagement is associated with an increase in depressive symptoms compared to moderate engagement, but only among young women. Reductions in self-esteem and sleep duration and quality appear to be more important mediators of the association of high engagement with depressive symptoms than online harassment or body weight satisfaction, but more research is needed on the precise mediating processes.

In,accordance;with. the principle of displacement, time consumption analysis confirms a relationship between television viewing time and reading time, although many variables are influential in this process. Time budget analysis also indicates that the decline in reading-time has not :been equal across different print,media. The article presents the results of a research project. that combined, qualitative and quantitative research techniques to analyse the media usage of Flemish 16- to 18-year-olds. The results demonstrate that. reading is influenced by many different variables, among which socializing variables are the strongest. The hypothesis that television viewing time has a negative effect on reading time has, to be differentiated since the results show a different relationship between viewing time and the reading of books, magazines and newspapers respectively.

TI  - From Displacement to Integration: An Examination of the Associations between Mobile Information and Communications Technology Use and Daily Time Use
AU  - Li, CJ
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The way information and communications technologies (ICTs) influence everyday life has long been discussed in time-use research. Though there has been a shift from stationary devices (e.g., desktops) to mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones) to accessing Internet, few studies thoroughly examine the impacts on time use caused by the latter. Moreover, mobile devices are used differently in daily life, entailing different implications on time use. Drawing upon urban population in the 2018 Time Use Survey in China, this study compares daily time use among four mobile ICT uses, namely, non-users, light users, medium users, and heavy users. A theoretical perspective of integration is proposed in this study to examine the associations between time use and mobile ICT use, which treats mobile ICT use as a channel to achieve multiple activity purposes instead of a homogenous free-time activity. Results show that mobile ICT use is integrated with paid work, part of non-paid labour including tutoring children and purchasing, and most of free-time activities including social communication and reading, which is inconsistent with the negative associations between ICT use and these activities in exiting literature. Mobile ICT use is also positively associated with travel, companions with other acquaintances, and secondary free-time activities, which is different from stationary ICT use. Moreover, the associations vary across different mobile ICT users. Light users have the most work and travel time, while heavy users have the least non-paid labour and the most free time, indicating group-specific implications. The explanation and implications of the associations are finally discussed.

Using 2016 and 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data, we find that internet use is significantly associated with lower life satisfaction. The association is stronger in the female, age 71 and above and low-income groups. Mediation analysis suggests that social capital has a significant mediating effect in linking internet use and life satisfaction, accounting for about 25% of the total effect of internet use. Based on the findings, we recommend appropriate interventions for internet use and promote social inclusion of migrant older adults, so as to further improve their quality of life.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
AB  - The issue of whether the internet promotes political participation has always been a hotly debated topic in academia. However, current research lacks an effective classification of the modes of internet use, and it does not analyze their effect on different forms of political participation. Based on data from the 2015 and 2018 waves of the China Urban Governance Survey, this study offers an examination of the internet usage behavior of Chinese urban netizens from the perspectives of internet involvement and information consumption, as well as comparing the impact that different modes of internet use have on conventional and unconventional political participation. The results of this study confirm the "citizen-empowerment hypothesis" of internet use, and show that the "group involvement-social-information-oriented" mode of internet use has a positive effect on the conventional and unconventional political participation of urban internet users. However, the study fails to support the "time-displacement hypothesis". It shows that the "individual involvement-entertainment-oriented" mode of internet use does not have a negative impact on the conventional and unconventional political participation of Chinese urban internet users. Similarly, the "group involvement-entertainment-oriented" mode of internet use has no significant effect on unconventional political participation. Taken together, the study shows that, in general, internet use has promoted the political participation of Chinese urban netizens, but there are significant differences between the different modes of internet use. As a revolutionary medium, the internet not only provides people with a convenient way of obtaining and communicating information, but also creates more challenges for state governance. The way in which the government should deal with different forms of political participation in the internet age will be an important research topic in the future.

AB  - We study the role of alcohol and emotions in explaining the dynamics in domestic abuse following major football games. We match confidential and uniquely detailed individual call data from Greater Manchester with the timing of football matches over a period of eight years to estimate the effect on domestic abuse. We find that a football game changes the dynamics of abuse throughout the day. We first observe a decrease in incidents during the 2-hour duration of the game suggesting a substitution effect of football and domestic abuse. However, following the initial decrease, and after the game, domestic abuse starts increasing and peaks about ten hours after the game. We find that these effects are the strongest for early games and are driven by male perpetrators that had consumed alcohol. We find that football games lead to changing the dynamics from earlier to later periods in the day consistent with displacement effects, yet in the case when games are early and the perpetrator is alcoholized, football games lead to a cumulative increase in abuse. Unexpected game results are not found to differently affect domestic abuse dynamics.

AB  - The role of digital technology in the lives of older adults is becoming increasingly critical. Guided by the displacement theory, this study examines the characteristics of older Internet users, the relationship between Internet use and common activities, and the relationship between Internet use and happiness among Chinese older adults. Using the 2018 and 2021 Chinese General Social Survey data, the study found that Internet use was generally associated with active and increased engagement in most activities, except for watching traditional mediums (TV/DVDs). Meanwhile, the connection between Internet use and perceived happiness was not established, as only the unadjusted models in 2018 showed a significant positive association between daily Internet use and older adults' perceived happiness. This study underscores the potential of digital technology to support active aging and calls for holistic digital integration strategies. The findings have significant implications for policymakers and stakeholders in creating an age-friendly digital environment in today's evolving digital era in China and beyond.

AB  - How do children and adolescents integrate the so-called 'new' media, i.e computer-based media and services, as a part of their media environment? Will they displace other media! This question is analysed for three countries, Flanders, Germany and Sweden. The focus of the comparative analyses is to identify general trends in how young people deal with new media offers, rather than to describe and explain intercultural differences. First we report general findings on media availability and use of young people in the three countries. Television undoubtedly still occupies a dominant position in the lives of children and teenagers in all the countries involved. With regard to PC and television console games, availability and amount of use differ considerably, with Swedish young people being ahead of those in Flanders and Germany. Second, correlational and factor analyses lead to remarkably similar factor structures for the three factors, indicating that these correlations represent more general trends in how young people combine different media; Third, we define different patterns of media use in clustering the respondents according to their amount of use for different media. Finally, the results are discussed with regard to societal processes like individualization, globalization and economization.

AU  - Ai, M
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - The study used a five-wave latent growth model to compare two sets of competing hypotheses about the influence of overall computer and Internet use on mental health. The secondary data set from the Korean Youth Panel Survey (KYPS) with a valid sample size of 2,003 respondents was used for the analysis. The mediating role of friendshipcloseness was examined to compare the social augmentation hypothesis with the social displacement hypothesis. The mediating role of academic stress was tested to compare the mood enhancement hypothesis with the problematic Internet use (PIU) model. The study was consistent with the social displacement hypothesis, where a higher initial computer and Internet use predicted a lower initial friendshipcloseness, which, in turn, resulted in a faster decrease in mental health. The study provided reconciliation for the mood enhancement hypothesis and the PIU model. Although a higher initial computer and Internet use predicted lower initial mental health levels through academic stress, schoolchildren and adolescents with more computer and Internet use experienced a slower decrease in mental health because of the mediating role of academic stress.

TI  - Cell phone use predicts being an "active couch potato": results from a cross-sectional survey of sufficiently active college students
AU  - Lepp, A

T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective "Active couch potato" describes an individual who is sufficiently physically active yet highly sedentary. Cell phones promote activities understood as sedentary behaviors (e.g. watching videos). Research demonstrates that cell phone use is positively associated with sedentary behavior. Although sedentary behavior typically displaces physical activity, no relationship between cell phone use and physical activity has been found. Thus, it is possible that some sufficiently active individuals are also high-frequency cell phone users and therefore highly sedentary. In other words, cell phone use may predict being an "active couch potato" among active people. Testing this hypothesis was the purpose of this study. "Active couch potatoes" are of concern as the negative effects of excessive sedentary behavior are independent of the benefits of physical activity. Methods College students (228) completed validated surveys assessing physical activity, sedentary behavior, and cell phone use. Using a previously validated method, participants were rated as sufficiently active or not based upon their physical activity survey score. Participants who were not sufficiently active were excluded from further analysis resulting in a final sample of 171. These sufficiently active individuals were categorized as "active couch potatoes" if they were also highly sedentary (i.e. sitting for eight or more hours/day). Logistic regression determined if cell phone use predicted being categorized as an "active couch potato." Results Cell phone use was a significant, positive predictor of being an "active couch potato." With each additional hour of daily cell phone use, the odds of becoming an "active couch potato" increased by 11.4% (Wald = 5.934, P = 0.015, Exp(B) = 1.114). On average, active couch potatoes used their cell phone 1.7 hours more each day than their sufficiently active but not overly sedentary peers. Conclusion Increased cell phone use was a significant predictor of being an "active couch potato." Explanations and implications are discussed.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - According to the displacement hypothesis, screen media use might displace time children have to devote to other activities. In this study, we tested the displacement and related hypotheses, and explored how associations varied cross-culturally. We collected time-use diaries from 198 children in Boston, United States (U.S.), and Mexico City, Mexico. Comparing across research sites, children in Mexico City invested more time consuming media, while Boston children spent more time playing outdoors. In Boston, time spent using media was negatively associated with engagement in play and several other in-home activities, while in Mexico City, media use was positively associated with indoor activities like play. In both sites, media use and time spent outside were inversely related. We interpret these findings considering (a) the displacement and other competing hypotheses on the effects of media on children's time use and (b) known cultural/regional differences between the U.S. and Mexico.

AB  - I investigate the relationship between sports-based entertainment and crime using nine years of hourly data on robberies and thefts by police district in Sao Paulo linked to information on 430 football matches. Results report a citywide voluntary incapacitation impact and a local spatial concentration effect. Robberies significantly drop during matches, especially high-audience ones. Around the stadiums, this effect is outweighed by that of concentration. While I find no evidence of spatial displacement, temporal displacement is at play, with offenses being moved up to pre-game time. I show that the game-crime link is likely deployed through potential criminals rather than victims.

TI  - Internet experience and time displacement of traditional news media use: An application of the theory of the niche
AU  - Ha, L

T2  - TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - The purpose of this study is to better understand the impact of online news use on traditional news media use by analyzing how Internet experience affects the time on traditional news media consumption. Based on the theory of the niche and the uses and gratifications theory, this study investigates the displacement effect of the Internet on consumer time spent on traditional media. Data were collected in a mail survey with 688 respondents in Northwest Ohio and college students in a Northwest Ohio state university from October to December, 2009. The results indicate that the Internet indeed has a displacement effect on traditional media in the daily news domain and the effect takes place most prominently after 5 years of experience. Consumers' time spent on traditional media decreases as the years of Internet experience increases with diminishing returns. Among experienced Internet users, there was an increasing overlap between the Internet and traditional media, and they perceived the Internet as superior to traditional media.

AB  - Objectives: The severity of different internet gaming disorder (IGD) symptoms criteria has not been explored much. The study describes the phenomenology of IGD in adolescents with comorbid psychiatric disorders attending child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient department (OPD). Materials and Methods: A total of 46 adolescents aged 13-16 years, who have attended child and adolescent psychiatry OPD, of a tertiary care teaching hospital for psychiatric disorders, with a history of gaming and who fulfilled criteria as per the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) for IGD have been included. All the adolescents have then assessed using semi-structured pro forma, internet gaming disorder scale (IGDS), and K-SADS-PL. Results: In the study sample, the most common IGDS criterion was "conflict" and the least common criterion was "tolerance." The IGDS mean score of "conflict" was the highest while of "displacement" was the least. "Escape" and "deception" were significantly higher for females. "Displacement" was significantly higher for urban domicile and online mode of gaming. "Persistence" was significantly higher for those who were gaming on personal devices and playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). Psychiatric disorders associated with IGD were ODD (46.66%), dissociative disorder (24.44%), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, 17.77%), and depressive disorder (11.11%). Phenomenology of IGD was comparable across all psychiatric comorbidities, except subjects with dissociative disorders, who had significantly higher scores for "escape" than for ADHD and depression. Furthermore, subjects with ODD had significantly higher scores for "displacement" than the subjects with dissociative disorder in terms of IGDS scores. Conclusion: Significant differences in the severity of DSM-5-IGD symptoms criteria are found in terms of gender, domicile, gaming genre (MMORPGs), accessibility of smartphones, online/offline modes of gaming, and the associated psychiatric comorbidity.

TI  - Do Boys and Girls Use Computers Differently, and Does It Contribute to Why Boys do Worse in School Than Girls?
AU  - Fairlie, RW
T2  - B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY
AB  - Boys are doing worse in school than are girls, which has been dubbed "the Boy Crisis." An analysis of the latest data on educational outcomes among boys and girls reveals extensive disparities in grades, reading and writing test scores, and other measurable educational outcomes, and these disparities exist across family resources and race. Focusing on disadvantaged schoolchildren, I then examine whether time investments made by boys and girls related to computer use contribute to the gender gap in academic achievement. Data from several sources indicate that boys are less likely to use computers for schoolwork and are more likely to use computers for playing games, but are less likely to use computers for social networking and email than are girls. Using data from a large field experiment randomly providing free personal computers to schoolchildren for home use, I also test whether these differential patterns of computer use displace homework time and ultimately translate into worse educational outcomes among boys. No evidence is found indicating that personal computers crowd out homework time and effort for disadvantaged boys relative to girls. Home computers also do not have negative effects on educational outcomes such as grades, test scores, courses completed, and tardies for disadvantaged boys relative to girls.

T2  - TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
AB  - Approximately 40% of the population enjoy access to the Internet via mobile phones in Japan, where user needs have driven developments of the mobile Internet such as "i-mode". After reviewing mobile Internet services in Japan, this article examines key social and cultural factors of mobile Internet use based on nationally representative surveys focusing on differences between PC and mobile Internet. The results demonstrate that mobile Internet is a more time-enhancing activity while PC Internet is a more time-displacing activity. Additionally, this article discusses unique Japanese cultural factors affecting communication patterns characterized by the high disclosure of subjective self and low disclosure of objective self, which may explain the unique usage patterns of the mobile Internet in Japan.

T2  - COMMUNICATIONS-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB  - The question how offline media use is related to online media use has been heavily debated in the last decades. If they are functionally equivalent, then advantages like low costs, rapid publication cycles, and easy access to online news could lead to them displacing offline news. Data from a large-scale survey with detailed questions about media use in the Netherlands show that, interestingly, the functions that online and offline media are used for are often the same: Those who use online media to gain a broad overview of the news, for fast updates, or for background information use offline media for the same purpose. There are some differences, though: For many citizens, the need of a broad overview of the news seems to be fulfilled by repertoires consisting of several outlets of different types, while they seem to have favorite specific outlets for news updates or background information, respectively. This suggests that outlets can especially focus on the latter two functions to distinguish themselves.

AB  - One supposed benefit of authorizing video gaming terminals (VGTs) outside of casinos is to improve the fiscal health of local governments. Illinois passed the Video Gaming Act in 2009, enabling individual municipalities to allow VGTs. To date, the machines have generated $400 million in municipal tax revenues and $2 billion for the state. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that adjusts for staggered adoption to isolate the causal effect of VGTs on municipal revenues. We find that VGTs displace other local taxable retail, leaving total municipal revenues unchanged. The video gaming act merely reallocated economic activity and did little to improve municipal finances.

T2  - ANNALES-ANALI ZA ISTRSKE IN MEDITERANSKE STUDIJE-SERIES HISTORIA ET SOCIOLOGIA
AB  - There is a lack of research concerning the role of the media in the lives of children under the age of 9 years. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine children's access to the media including time periods of media consumption, affinity to certain media and displacement of other activities by media. The study approach involved a combination of quantitative (representative survey of Slovenian children's parents) and qualitative research (in-depth interviews with 35 children from Primorska) This is the first study from the existing literature available that which includes parents as well as their children in the study.The survey shows that television is still the most consumed medium (2.3 hours per day), followed by games (1.2 hours per day), radio (40 minutes per day), Internet (10 minutes per week), books (20 minutes per day) and magazines (20 minutes per week).A key finding of the survey is that the media consumption increases with age. This can be explained by greater cognitive ability to understand the media content as well as greater skill in playing games. The survey revealed statistically significant differences in media consumption by gender, since girls tend to watch more television, listen more to the radio content and read more books and magazines more frequently than boys who, on their part, devote quadruple the amount of time to playing games on consoles and using the Internet.The majority of Slovenian children habitually multitask. Watching TV while simultaneously doing homework and performing other creative activities is a common everyday practice of children.Children have the highest affinity for television. This is followed by playing games on gaming consoles. This is truer of boys than for girls, who on their part prefer talking on mobile phones. Girls prefer to read than boys, but even they are not reading enough. The results of the qualitative and quantitative research were most diverse in the activity area of reading. More parents than children interviewed (only one girl) claim that they (the children) would miss reading.Only a few signs of displacement were found between TV and reading, drawing, game-playing and participation in organised sports activities. Our findings are more consistent with the "more is more" hypothesis, indicating that active media users will be socially active children.

AB  - The phenomenon of reading is a key element of sociocultural activities. Importantly, reading is "built in" media consumption in general. No less important is that the media environment of modern society has been going through a profound transformation last 5 to 7 years. Within these circumstances, the project focusses on the following research questions. What is the place of reading (newspapers, magazines, books both printed and electronic) in today's media consumption? How television and various online activities affect reading? What determines electronic book consumption nowadays? What are the social consequences of ever more popular digital reading?Empirical data came from representative surveys of communication behavior of urban population in Russia (15+ years old; year 2010: N=3000, and 2014: N=2100). Formalized personal interviews at home have been used. Several statistical procedures used for testing our hypotheses, including logistic regression.The research proves that using electronic devices for reading books, newspapers and magazines is gaining popularity among Russian audiences. We found that preference for digital reading is primarily predicted by sociodemographic variables, incumbent practice of other media usage, and ownership of new communication devices. Social implications of digital reading are analyzed using concepts of media displacement and mediatization. We assume that digital reading is changing earlier practices of text perception as well as cognition in general. The results are discussed within the context of today's discourse about the place of reading in connection with: information overload of contemporary people; diminishing traditional consumption of books; traits of new digital generations; and the dilemma of "book" versus "screen" culture which is an essential part of modern and postmodern personality. Discussing Russian prospects, we use cross-country comparisons that allow us to show the varying pace of innovation in book consumption and the role of social and cultural context.

AB  - Although some argue that Internet use may erode involvement in public life, the most common Internet behaviors, social communication and information searching, may actually foster social and civic participation. To examine this possibility, we test a series of non-recursive models using a national survey of nearly 3,400 respondents. Two-stage least squares regressions were performed to simultaneously test the reciprocal relationship between frequency of Internet use (i.e., hours per day) and three sets of community engagement behaviors: informal social interaction, attendance at public events, and participation in civic volunteerism (i.e., annual frequency). Time spent online has a positive relationship with public attendance and civic volunteerism. No evidence of time displacement from frequency of Internet use is observed.

T2  - MOBILE MEDIA & COMMUNICATION
AB  - Due to separation from their families and friends in their home countries and constrained living conditions in the host countries, migrant workers usually are found to experience loneliness. Compared with male migrant workers, female migrant workers are more vulnerable and likely to experience higher levels of psychological problems. The ubiquity of mobile phones enables migrant workers to access resources and social support to help to alleviate loneliness. However, research also suggests that mobile phone use may lead to a higher level of loneliness because problematic or excessive use displaces meaningful social interactions. This study investigates this mobile phone paradox among Filipino domestic workers (FDWs) in Hong Kong. Specifically, it explores the relationships between mobile phone use and two types of loneliness, namely social and emotional loneliness. Further, informed by the augmentation hypothesis and the displacement hypothesis, this research advances a two-path model to illustrate how mobile phone use connects with loneliness through social support and problematic mobile phone use. Findings from a survey of 492 FDWs reveal disjunctive effects. There is no direct correlation between mobile phone use and the two types of loneliness. Both problematic mobile phone use and social support are found to mediate the negative association between mobile phone use and social loneliness, while only problematic mobile phone use mediates the positive association between mobile phone use and emotional loneliness. Implications of the research on migrant workers' mobile phone use and practical implications for social work and government efforts in helping FDWs dealing with loneliness are discussed.

T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Social media use has increased tremendously over the last few years, generating immense interest in the phenomenon in both research and practice. Hence, this study takes a quantitative (survey design) approach to empirically examine the user (consumer) level factors that influence social media use, their consequences, and the moderating effects of consumer demographic variables (age and gender). The findings suggest that while external pressure from a consumer's referent group influence their social media use, the consumer's personal values does not. Moreover, social media use generates bridging social capital and subjective wellbeing among consumers. The empirical analysis also shows that consumer demographic variables (age and gender) do not have any significant differences in their use of social media. We shed light on the relative effects of these antecedents on social media use from a holistic perspective employing the social presence theory. This study also contributes to the augmentation and displacement hypotheses of computer-mediated communication and tends to support the augmentation hypothesis. The results will also be useful for firms by employing techniques that would arouse interest and curiosity to attract the attention of social media users.

T2  - MOBILE MEDIA & COMMUNICATION
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in older adults' mobile phone use from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. The media displacement and digital divide approaches served as the theoretical frameworks of the study. The data were drawn from the 2018 and 2020 waves of the Aging + Communication + Technology cross-national longitudinal panel study. The sample consisted of older Internet users, aged 62 to 96 (in 2018), from Austria, Canada, Finland, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, and Spain, who participated in both waves (N = 4,398). Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis with multinomial regression models were the main methods applied to the data. With regard to the findings, three mobile phone function use profiles-Narrow Use, Medium Use, and Broad Use-were identified from the data. Lower age, being married, higher income, and place of residence (in 2018) predicted belonging to the three profiles, while country differences in the prevalence of the profiles were substantial. Between 2018 and 2020, transition from one profile to another was relatively rare but typically toward the "Broad Use" category. Profile transitions were most common in Romania, while stability was highest in Finland, Israel, and Canada. In addition, gender, age, marital status, and place of residence predicted the likelihood of changing from one profile to another between 2018 and 2020. The results suggest that older adults' mobile phone function use is relatively stable over a two-year time span. While new mobile phone functions are adopted, they seem to augment the spectrum of mobile usage rather than displace older similar functionalities. In addition, demographic, socioeconomic, and country-level digital divides, although slightly modified over time, remain significant among older adults.

AB  - Children today spend an unprecedented amount of their time watching or interacting with screens. In this research, we examined the use of screen time (both television and electronic media use) in relation to preschoolers' language development and the parent -child relationship. Participants were 84 parents and their preschoolers. Children ranged in age from 3 to 5 years old. Parents provided survey data and children were assessed on language ability and comprehension. Results show that preschool children who spent more time on screens, both television viewing and electronic media use, scored lower on language production, language comprehension, and parent -child closeness. Further, we found support for the displacement hypothesis, with significant indirect effects of screen time on language and parent -child closeness through reductions in shared reading and quality parent -child interactions.

AB  - The rapid adoption of video gaming among children has placed tremendous strain on parents' ability to manage their children's consumption. While parents refer online to video games ratings (VGR) information to support their mediation efforts, there are many difficulties associated with such practice. This paper explores the popular VGR sites, and highlights the inadequacies of VGRs to capture the parents' concerns, such as time displacement, social interactions, financial spending and various video game effects, beyond the widespread panics over content issues, that is subjective, ever-changing and irrelevant. As such, this paper argues for a shift from content-centric to a parent-centric approach in VGRs, that captures the evolving nature of video gaming, and support parents, the main users of VGRs, in their management of their young video gaming children. This paper proposes a Video Games Repository for Parents to represent that shift.

AB  - Over the past 3 years, tablet computers have become increasingly popular devices. In particular, Apple's iPad and its accompanying apps have taken the tablet market by storm. The technology enables users to accomplish a variety of tasks, including viewing television (TV) programs and other video sources on the device. Based on media uses and gratifications, an exploratory study examined whether the iPad was replacing traditional TV viewing. Results showed that, rather than displacing time with TV, the amount of TV viewing on an iPad was positively related to the amount of time watching traditional TV.

AB  - A variety of online support groups exist for "gaming widows" who feel their spousal relationship has been displaced by time spent playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game(s) (MMORPGs). MMORPG research has been presented on youth and adults, however to date, there is no research on married gamers to support or refute the claims of discontented spouses. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the gaining behaviors of couples who play MMORPGs. The sample included 349 couples. Results indicated lower marital satisfaction related to couples' MMORPG gaming interactions such as quarrelling about gaming, not retiring to bed at the same time, and addictive gaining behavior. Positive effects of gaming together were also identified.

T2  - COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB  - Social media has substantially changed how people consume media content, particularly during sport mega-events. This study examined the audience social media uses during the "most social Olympics" and found that demographics, personality, motivations, preference, media use routine, and viewing context significantly predicted social media consumption for the Rio Games. Olympics viewing on social media was predominately predicted by media use routine, while following and posting on social media about the Olympics appeared to be a more "active" choice that was shaped by personal identity and virtual schemas. In addition, results indicate that social media uses during the Rio Games neither "displaced" nor "encouraged" Olympics viewing on traditional television. Uses of social media suggest a digital expansion of "group" viewing and transform ways in which the audience can experience a sport mega-event.

TI  - Mobile media: communicating with and by Indigenous youth about alcohol
AU  - Trees, K
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper argues for the use of mobile media technology and youth engagement in creating health promotion messages aimed at young people. It also provides an account of researchers and Indigenous people and organisations working together to build skills beyond the specific research. It does this by drawing on an evaluation of an alcohol awareness campaign carried out by Goolarri Media via television and radio. The author and her collaborator carried out this evaluation with assistance from organisations and individuals in Broome, Western Australia, during the period May to August 2010. The three core objectives were to assess audience awareness of the campaign, to assess audience opinion of the campaign, and to gauge any change in audience behaviours and attitudes towards alcohol consumption. The target audience for the media campaign, and hence the main target population for data collection and analysis, was Indigenous youth in Broome and the wider Kimberley region (the broadcast area of Goolarri TV and Radio). This paper discusses the effectiveness of the television and radio advertisements and reports general findings, including that inclusion of local youth in the advertisements and in the design and production of the campaign was a positive factor, and that both Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth use telephones and other aspects of mobile media for social networking and entertainment, displacing television viewing and radio listening to a significant extent. The findings indicated that future advertising campaigns aimed at Indigenous youth in cities or regional centres should concentrate on mobile software technology add social media opportunities. The paper explores in detail two of the most interesting findings: disengagement of youth and the rise of mobile media use. Analysis of the synergistic qualitative and quantitative data from the study also leads to the conclusion that youth involvement in creating, accessing and sharing knowledge facilitates health promotion.

TI  - Online Communication and Adolescent Social Ties: Who benefits more from Internet use?*
AU  - Lee, SJ
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION
AB  - Literature suggests 4 hypotheses to explain social outcomes of online communication among adolescents: displacement, increase, rich-get-richer, and social-compensation hypotheses. The present study examines which hypothesis is supported, considering differences in social ties (time vs. quality of social relationships; parent-child relationships; friendships; school connectedness). This study's sample was 1,312 adolescents ages 12 to 18. Displacement hypothesis predicted negative associations between time in online communication and time with parents, but time with friends was not displaced. Examination of relationships among earlier sociability, online communication, and cohesive friendships supported the rich-get-richer hypothesis. That is, adolescents who already had strong social relationships at earlier ages were more likely to use online communication, which in turn predicted more cohesive friendships and better connectedness to school.

AU  - Huh, YJ
T2  - CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD
AB  - In contrast to studies focusing on digital games as learning tools, this study shows how young children use digital games as a means of facilitating spontaneous play in their everyday lives. This article highlights how 4 three-year-old children's play with digital games revealed their ability to create new forms of play by mixing their digital game play and other play in real life. In addition, this study shows various examples of young children breaking game boundaries (e.g. rule-breaking; using virtual space as a source for their spontaneous play; navigating between virtual and physical space for their play) in their digital game playing. This finding suggests that digital games do not entirely change or displace other practices in early childhood, but young children's digital game play is very closely related to their spontaneous play as it occurs in their everyday lives. Young children are agentic and capable users of digital technologies, incorporating the digital world for their own purposes.

T2  - The Counseling Psychologist
AB  - Explores the effects of dominant mass media upon counseling with respect to the need for personal conversation and the demand for professional counseling in a mass-mediated culture. The counseling transaction is viewed in a media context, and the possibility is raised that clients may be expecting relatively straightforward, technical solutions to their predefined problems, thereby reflecting the modern media bias toward "tech-fixes" for human difficulties. Also addressed are the media's contributions to specific complaints and conditions, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety, and the "losing touch" phenomenon. The effect of the media in displacing alternate activities as well as self-generated information is regarded in terms of its impact on an individual's life-style and psychological economy.

AU  - Hornik, Robert
T2  - Review of Educational Research
AB  - The paper categorizes the hypotheses that have related home television use to schooling-hypotheses of time and energy displacement, of interest stimulation, of learning of school-equivalent content, of acquisition of novel intellectual skills, of development of intolerance for the slow pace of class activities, and of learning expectations with regard to what schooling is about and what it is for. Available evidence about overall effects suggests a small effect on reading growth, hints at a tendency for socially advantaged children to be most vulnerable to effects, generally, and is largely uninformative as to the validity of particular explanatory hypotheses. The utility of alternative research approaches, cross-sectional and panel surveys, laboratory and field experiments, and quasi-experiments are examined.

AB  - Assembled 274 correlations spanning 26 yrs from 23 educational and psychological review articles, doctoral dissertations, statewide assessments, national surveys, technical reports, books, and unpublished papers in order to integrate empirical findings concerning the impact of leisure time TV on student achievement from kindergarten through Grade 12. For each study, characteristics of the sample, type of outcome, quality of the study, method of collecting viewing data, mean hours of viewing, and strength and direction of observed relationships were coded. The overall correlation of hours of televiewing and achievement was negative but small. Regardless of the sample size, year, and location of the research, the effect remained consistent. The overall effect, however, was not constant across the range of viewing times. The effects were slightly positive for up to 10 hrs of viewing a week, but beyond 10 hrs the effects were negative and increasingly more deleterious until viewing time reached 35-40 hrs, beyond which additional viewing had little effect. Females and high IQ children were more adversely affected than other groups. Results may reflect differences in the kinds of activities displaced by TV or in the kinds of programs viewed. An annotated appendix of the studies is included. (38 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

It is suggested that parents should monitor TV viewing so that it does not distract from schoolwork; critics should make clear to viewers that educational TV is entertaining rather than educative; and educators should cease trying to be media for entertainment.

The authors of this research volume have eschewed all of the casual or merely convenient data collection schemes that have often plagued large-scale field studies in the past. The impact of TV can be divided into displacement effects and content effects, and Williams and her collaborators do justice to both. Content effects included television's teaching of conventional sex role differences and an increased tendency after the arrival of TV reception toward aggressive behavior on the school playgrounds. The effects attributable to television viewing are not the simple, sovereign ones proclaimed by both the Cassandras and the zealots. Williams and her colleagues are similarly sensitive to the differential impact of TV on different types of viewers. In sum, despite the difficulties involved in completing a long-term natural experiment, Williams and her associates have done a model study.

AB  - A synthesis of 8 statewide reading assessments and a secondary analysis of the 1984 National Assessment of Educational Progress, which included measures of scholastic achievement, out-of-school activities, and reported TV viewing exposure, were used to analyze 4 theories of how TV viewing displaces other activities in school-age children. Results indicate that differences in reading scores for Ss watching 2-4 hrs/day were small beyond 4 hrs of viewing, the effects were negative and increasingly deleterious. Analysis of outside activities suggested that TV viewing was tied to a different set of needs and gratifications than leisure reading, sports, or spending time with friends. For most Ss, however, time spent on TV viewing was tempered by the increasing demands of schooling and the onset of social activities.

Results are discussed in terms of VCR user intent, taping motivation, and viewing pattern interactions. Findings suggest that (1) displacement of other media and forms occurred with the acquisition of a VCR; (2) tapers tended to be quite explicit in their content preferences; and (3) advertisers can identify and take advantage of the longevity of particular kinds of content as determined by reasons for taping.

Multi-users, who engaged in recreational and intellectual computer use, were the most infrequent LRs. Low users were the most frequent LRs. Computer use may be functionally equivalent to reading for some children and may be displacing time they would otherwise spend with print media.

AU  - Rust, Roland T

T2  - Journal of Business Research
AB  - The authors argue that interactive media, such as the Internet, will functionally displace traditional mass media, because interactive media will be better able to serve the communication needs of individuals. The authors show that in the age of interactivity audiences will shift from being large, heterogeneous, and anonymous to being small, homogeneous, and addressable. The authors expect this shift in audience characteristics to radically change the nature of advertising. The authors predict that in the age of interactivity, advertising will be less intrusive, better-targeted, more information-oriented, and more accountable for bottom-line results. Furthermore, advertisers will be required to design messages to get past "intelligent" software that aid individuals in decision-making. The authors recommend that advertising agencies internalize their role as marketing communication specialists to successfully adapt to an interactive media environment characterized by a multiplicity of audiences and channels.

AU  - Robinson, John P
AU  - Barth, Kevin
AU  - Kohut, Andrew
T2  - Social Science Computer Review
AB  - One measure of the impact of the personal computer is in terms of its time displacement of other activities. Mass media generally are considered a prime candidate given the on-line profusion of information and entertainment services. This article compares the daily mass media habits of heavy, light, and nonusers of personal computers and on-line services based on 1994 and 1995 national surveys conducted by the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press. No significant or consistent evidence of time displacement of mass media was found. Indeed, heavier computer usage was associated with significantly greater use of the print media and movies, even after multivariate adjustment. It is concluded that at this stage of diffusion, personal computers may have more in common with "time-enhancing" home appliances (e.g., automobile, washing machine) than they do with television. Nonetheless, more complete time diary studies are needed to identify the full temporal effects of the personal computer, much as they did for television.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of online media on other media and family communication. Data gathered from 185 adults and children in 84 households indicate that time spent in television viewing, newspaper reading, telephone usage, and family conversations is affected by online use. Usage of online media is significantly different among genders and generations. A process of functional displacement may be occurring in which television is being gradually displaced by online media as the primary source of information.

TI  - Social relationships and Internet use among adolescents in Israel.
AU  - Mesch, Gustavo S
T2  - Social Science Quarterly
AB  - Examined the relationship between youth leisure activities, peer relations, and prosocial attitudes and the frequency of Internet use among adolescents in Israel. Hypotheses were tested using data from a face-to-face survey of a representative sample of the Israeli youth population (n=927; mean age 16 yrs) conducted in February 1998. It was found that the lower an individual's level of attachment to close friends and the less prosocial attitudes he/she expressed, the higher was the likelihood of his/her being a frequent Internet user. However, Internet users were more likely than nonusers to participate in social activities such as parties, singers' performances, and sports activities. It is concluded that contrary to public perceptions it appears that among the adolescent population of Israel, Internet use is not displacing other social activities. However, adolescents who are more socially isolated are more likely to be frequent Internet users. It is suggested that future research should explore whether for this group, the Internet is being used to overcome individuals' barriers to the formation of social relationships.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To examine the longitudinal, bidirectional associations between the parent-reported frequency of using mobile devices to calm young children and children’s executive functioning (EF) and emotional reactivity, testing moderation by child sex and temperament. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included a community-based convenience sample of English-speaking parents of typically developing children aged 3 to 5 years. The study duration was from August 2018 to January 2020, with baseline (T1), 3-month follow-up (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3) waves. EXPOSURES Parent-reported frequency of use of mobile devices to calm children when upset (5-point Likert scale). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At each wave, the child’s EF was assessed with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function–Preschool Version Global Executive Composite and emotional reactivity with the Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Reactivity subscale. Structural equation models were built to examine cross-lagged associations of the use of devices for calming, EF, and emotional reactivity, testing for moderation by child sex or temperament (Child Behavior Questionnaire–Very Short Form surgency score, median split).
RESULTS Of 422 eligible parents with data at T1, 375 (88.9%) provided data at T2 and 366 (86.7%) at T3. At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 422 children was 3.8 (0.5) years, the number of boys in the sample was 224 (53.1%), the number of individuals of non-Hispanic White race and ethnicity was 313 (74.2%), and among the parents, 254 (60.2%) had a college degree or higher. Among the boys, the use of devices to calm at T2 was associated with higher emotional reactivity at T3 (r [standardized regression coefficient] = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10-0.30), while higher emotional reactivity at T2 had a nonsignificant association with increased device use for calming at T3 (r = 0.10; 95% CI, −0.01 to 0.21). Among children with high temperamental surgency, the use of devices to calm at T2 was associated with increased emotional reactivity at T3 (r = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22), while higher emotional reactivity at T2 was associated with increased device use for calming at T3 (r = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.24).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that the frequent use of mobile devices for calming young children may displace their opportunities for learning emotion-regulation strategies over time; therefore, pediatric health care professionals may wish to encourage alternate calming approaches.

AU  - Ahn, Dohyun

T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - This study provides a resolution for two contrasting hypotheses around media use, the augmentation and the displacement hypotheses. To do this, we conducted an online survey of 300 Korean adults examining the relationships among the social use of media, face-to-face communication, social isolation, connectedness, and subjective well-being. The results indicate that connectedness, not avoiding social isolation, mediates the effects of the social use of media on subjective well-being. On the other hand, both connectedness and avoiding social isolation mediate the effects of face-to-face communication on subjective well-being. These results suggest that the social use of media is limited to seeking connectedness to others, whereas face-to-face communication can facilitate avoiding social isolation as well as seeking connectedness, which can explain why the two contrasting hypothesis, the augmentation and the displacement hypotheses, can be right. In the domain of seeking connectedness, media can augment face-to-face communication. On the other hand, in the domain of avoiding social isolation, media may displace face-to-face communication.

TI  - Digital music consumption on the internet: evidence from clickstream data
AU  - Aguiar, Luis

T2  - Information Economics and Policy
AB  - We use clickstream data on a panel of more than 16,500 European consumers to analyze the relationship between different online music consumption channels. In particular, we revisit the question of sales displacement in the digital era, and analyze how licensed online music streaming affects digital music purchasing behavior. Our results show no evidence of digital music sales displacement by unlicensed downloading and present, for some countries in our sample, a rather small but positive elasticity of up to 0.04 between these two channels. We also ﬁnd a positive relationship between the use of licensed streaming websites and licensed websites selling digital music, suggesting a stimulating effect of music streaming on digital music sales. Our results present important cross country differences in these effects, with elasticities ranging between 0.09 and 0.01. Finally, we ﬁnd heterogeneous effects according to individuals’ proﬁles. For both unlicensed downloading and licensed streaming alike, our results suggest that consumers with higher interest in music view these channels as complements to licensed digital purchases to a larger extent. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Multiple systematic reviews support an association between higher rates of screen time and greater adiposity, and 1 systematic review suggested that an inverse relationship might exist between screen time and HDL-C. There is less consistent evidence of associations between screen time and other cardiometabolic risk factors such as diastolic or systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or metabolic syndrome, whereas high-quality prospective longitudinal studies are limited.

T2  - Annual Review Of Sociology
AB  - The Internet is a critically important research site for sociologists testing theories of technology diffusion and media effects, particularly because it is a medium uniquely capable of integrating modes of communication and forms of content. Current research tends to focus on the Internet&apos;s implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the “digital divide”); 2) community and social capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change. Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.

AB  - As people increasingly access movies, user-created content, and linear television programs through the Internet, scholars are paying attention to the effect of online video services on various media markets, including the broadcasting market. Focusing on South Korea, this study examines how changes in the time spent on online video services affect the time spent on other media: terrestrial TV, pay TV, terrestrial DMB, radio, SNSs, games, newspapers, and books. This study also examines how this time displacement effect of online videos on other media differs across various video content categories. The results show that an increase in the time spent on online video services reduces the time spent on cable TV and games. Among the online video content categories, broadcast network programs and cable network programs reduced the time spent on cable TV, and movies reduced the time spent on games. Moreover, the amount of time spent viewing online videos reduced the time spent on non-media activities but increased sleeping time.

T2  - Telematics and Informatics
AB  - With an increase in the users viewing video content through the Internet, the interest in the recent trend of the displacement of old media (e.g., TV, radio, or newspaper) by online video services has also increased. To examine this trend, this study analyzed the time people spent on online video services compared to the time they spent on old media. The study also assessed whether online video services reduced the time users participated in nonmedia activities. The results of the study indicated that the time spent on online video services negatively inﬂuenced (i.e., reduced) the time spent on old video media and nonmedia activities. However, it did not have a signiﬁcant effect on the time spent on old non-video media. In addition, the time spent on online video services was found to exert a greater inﬂuence on the time spent on non-media activities when compared to old video media. One of the reasons why the time spent on online video services reduces the time spent on both old video media and non-media activities is that the time spent viewing movies or TV programs through online video services negatively inﬂuences the time spent on these activities.

AB  - Polychronicity is time use preference, which people acquire through socialization. The literature shows that polychrons, who favor Simultaneous activities, and monochrons, who favor linear activities, exhibit different perceptual and behavioral patterns. This article examines the relationship among polychronicity, Internet skills, Internet use, and Internet perception. In addition, it investigates the hypothesis that Internet use displaces other activity. A total of 1,048 adult Singapore citizens and permanent residents participated in a computer-assisted telephone interview. Of these, 380 were non Internet users and 668 were users. For the purpose of this study, only responses from the 668 Internet users were included in the analyses. Two-stage least squares regression analyses showed that polychronicity was not associated with Internet use, but it predicted Internet perception. Internet skills positively predicted Internet use and perception. The Internet neither displaced nor promoted television viewing, radio listening, and newspaper reading. However, there was some indication that polychronicity suppressed television viewing.

T2  - Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between Internet use and six activities that are important to childhood development: television viewing, newspaper reading, radio listening, sports and physical exercise, interaction with family, and socializing with friends. Perceived importance of the Internet, television, newspaper, and radio as information sources was also included. A panel of 1,251 secondary-one students was surveyed in 1999, and was revisited in 2000. A total of 817 students remained in the 2000 survey, giving an attrition rate of 34.7%. Results showed that an increase in Internet use depressed television viewing, but stimulated newspaper reading, radio listening, and socializing with friends. However, it had no significant impact on physical activities and interaction with family members. Change in the perception of the importance of the Internet as an information source was also found to be related to the perceived importance of two other media sources. Limitations of the study were included in the discussion section.

AU  - Lemmens, Jeroen S.

T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - Pathological use of computer and video games has been associated with indicators of psychosocial wellbeing, such as loneliness, low self-esteem, low social competence, and low life satisfaction. However, few studies have decisively demonstrated whether these indicators of psychosocial well-being are causes or consequences of pathological gaming. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a two-wave panel study among 851 Dutch adolescents (543 gamers). Causal relations were analyzed using autoregressive structural equation models. These analyses indicated that social competence, self-esteem, and loneliness were signiﬁcant predictors of pathological gaming six months later. Thus, lower psychosocial well-being can be considered an antecedent of pathological gaming among adolescent gamers. Our analyses further indicated that loneliness was also a consequence of pathological gaming. This suggests that displacement of real-world social interaction resulting from pathological use of video games may deteriorate existing relationships, which could explain the increase in adolescent gamers’ feelings of loneliness.

AB  - The present study explored the role of gender in the association between Internet addiction and depression. Three-wave longitudinal panel data were collected from self-reported questionnaires that were completed by 1715 adolescents in grades 6e8 in China. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between Internet addiction and depression. In male adolescents, depression was found to signiﬁcantly predict subsequent Internet addiction, suggesting that depression was the cause of Internet addiction and supporting the mood enhancement hypothesis. In female adolescents, Internet addiction was found to signiﬁcantly predict subsequent depression, indicating that Internet addiction leads to depression and supporting the social displacement hypothesis. These results indicate that the relationship between Internet addiction and depression depended on gender. In addition, it was found that males and females exhibit different behavioral patterns and motivations of Internet usage. Males were more likely to use the Internet for pleasure and less likely to surf the Internet to search for information, compared with females. Although both males and females were prone to surﬁng the Internet alone, males were more likely to go online with friends compared with females. These ﬁndings suggest that gender-speciﬁc preventative and interventional strategies should be developed to reduce Internet addiction.

AB  - Scholars have an enduring interest in investigating whether a new medium displaces or complements existing media whenever a new medium is introduced to the society. In this study, it is sought to investigate the extent to which the mobile phone would replace or reinforce teens’ traditional Internet use through computers. Surveys were conducted on 1875 youths between 12 to 17 years old in 5 digital cities in East Asia: Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. The ﬁndings proﬁle a digital generation that is highly connected in the 21st century. Ninety percent of all respondents used the Internet. Almost 90% of the teens in this study used the mobile phone, and two-thirds of them ever surfed the Web via their mobile devices. Through a factor analysis, three dimensions of teens’ use of mobile Internet were identiﬁed, namely, task-based activities, information seeking and communication activities, and recreational activities. In general, the teens tend to use the mobile phone for recreation and entertainment purposes, especially playing games and listening to music. They are less likely to use the mobile phone for more sophisticated purposes, such as petitioning, voting, or shopping. Drawing upon the niche theory, the patterns between teens’ mobile Internet and PC Internet use were further compared. Our analysis shows that mobile Internet primarily serves as an extension of teens’ Internet activities via PC, rather than as a replacement. Such positive relationships are quadratic and non-linear.

TI  - Digital traps: How technology fuels nomophobia and insomnia in Taiwanese college students
AU  - Lin, Yi-Ching

T2  - Acta Psychologica
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between maladaptive digital technology use, which arises from nomophobia, and insomnia among young adults. It specifically focuses on problematic gaming (PG), problematic social media use (PSMU), and problematic YouTube use (PYTU) as significant forms of digital behavior contributing to this contemporary health concern. Adolescents and young adults, being the first generation raised in a highly digitized environment, encounter unique challenges, including the emergence of behavioral addictions. Our findings indicate a strong association between nomophobia and problematic digital behaviors, with PSMU identified as the most prevalent form of maladaptive use. Additionally, PG and PSMU are recognized as substantial contributors to the development of nomophobia. The interaction of cognitive overstimulation, emotional dysregulation, blue light exposure, time displacement, and reward-driven dependency on these digital platforms promotes compulsive behaviors, which subsequently lead to the onset of insomnia. Utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the study illustrates that nomophobia precipitates problematic digital behavior, which in turn results in sleep disturbances, thereby elucidating a clear pathway from digital dependency to insomnia. The limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data, which may introduce potential biases. Despite these limitations, our findings underscore the critical role of nomophobia in triggering insomnia through various maladaptive digital behaviors. This highlights the urgent need for targeted prevention and intervention strategies aimed at fostering healthier digital habits and alleviating the adverse health effects of excessive technology use, ultimately enhancing well-being in an increasingly interconnected society.

TI  - Loneliness unlocked: Associations with smartphone use and personality
AU  - MacDonald, Kristi Baerg

T2  - Acta Psychologica
AB  - Communication and relationships have been dramatically altered among emerging adults thanks to the rapid adoption of the smartphone in just over a decade. Studying the effects of evolving personal technology helps researchers understand both the detriments of widespread adoption and the benefits that accompany the technology. One such area of concern is the relationship of technology with loneliness. Emerging adulthood is described as the period of transition from adolescence to adulthood, taking place from age 18–25. This period is characterized by change, exploration, but also a vulnerability to psychological distress. Young adults are not only at greater risk of loneliness compared to other developmental stages, but report greater distress about being lonely (Rokach, 2000). Previous research has found support for the hypothesis that use of social communication on the Internet has a bidirectional relationship with loneliness (Nowland et al., 2018); use of the Internet can support relationships and decrease loneliness, but if used as a compensation for social skill deficits, the Internet can also displace quality time spent in relationships, and thereby increase loneliness. This study examines loneliness and its relationship with smartphone use, while also accounting for individual differences in facets of neuroticism, communication apprehension, emotional support, and nomophobia for emerging adults. Participants (N = 302; MAGE = 18.85) completed self-report measures of loneliness and the individual differences variables. They also reported average daily smartphone data of screen time, pickups, and application (app) use, which was measured by their personal devices. Correlations indicated loneliness was positively associated with screen time, social media app use, neuroticism, social recognition, communication anxiety, and nomophobia. Loneliness was negatively associated with smartphone pickups, communication application use, need for affiliation, and emotional support. A regression analysis revealed that neuroticism, need for affiliation, social recognition, emotional support, and smartphone pickups were significant predictors of loneliness, when taking into account all the individual difference and smartphone use variables. Neuroticism and loneliness have a strong relationship, but a hierarchical regression showed that over and above neuroticism and its facets, smartphone screen time and pickups predict loneliness. Overall, the results for this sample of emerging adults supported the hypotheses by Nowland et al. (2018) about social use of the Internet, but applied to smartphone use. More time spent on one's smartphone and on social media apps is related to increased loneliness, and is discussed in context of identity development. More frequent use (pickups) and use of communication apps is related to decreased loneliness and is discussed with respect to development of relationship intimacy. These results suggest that loneliness in young adults is related to different types of smartphone use, even when accounting for stable characteristics such as personality. Finally, neuroticism remains a significant variable in understanding loneliness, and further examination of lower-order facets help define a more nuanced profile in individual differences.

AB  - Objective: The current meta-analysis had two main goals. First, we wanted to provide an estimate of the average effect size of the relationship between sedentary video gaming and body mass. In doing so we acknowledged several context variables to gauge the stability of the average effect. Second, to provide additional evidence on processes, we tested the displacement effect of physical activity by video gaming time with the help of a metaanalytic structural equation model (MASEM).
Method: Published and unpublished studies were identified through keyword searches in different databases and references in relevant reports were inspected for further studies. We present a random-effects, three-level metaanalysis based on 20 studies (total N = 38,097) with 32 effect sizes.
Results: The analyses revealed a small positive relationship between non-active video game use and body mass, ̂ρ = .09, 95% CI [0.03, 0.14], indicating that they shared less than 1% in variance. The studies showed significant heterogeneity, Q (31) = 593.03, p < .001, I2 = 95.13. Moderator analyses revealed that the relationship was more pronounced for adults, ̂ρ = .22, 95% CI [0.04, 0.40], as compared to adolescents, ̂ρ = .01, 95% CI [-0.21, 0.23], or children, ̂ρ = .09, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.25]. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling found little evidence for a displacement of physical activity through time spent on video gaming.
Conclusion: These results do not corroborate the assumption of a strong link between video gaming and body mass as respective associations are small and primarily observed among adults.

AB  - This study examines gender effects in Japanese consumers’ media use in travel information search. Drawing upon gender theory and niche theory, we propose a causal model consisting of satisfaction, attitude, and habitual usage of distinct media. Speciﬁcally, we posit that females are more predisposed to media displacement–reinforcement effects than males, when mobile Internet becomes a more popular medium in travel information search than PC Internet and traditional media. We conducted an online panel survey in Japan, and collected 992 usable responses. Structural equation modeling ﬁnds that satisfaction with PC Internet and with traditional media affects the habitual use of mobile Internet negatively. Habitual use of mobile Internet is negatively associated with attitude toward PC Internet and toward traditional media. Although moderation analysis identiﬁes no statistical difference in the hypothesized paths, latent mean analysis reveals that satisfaction from, attitude toward, and habitual usage of mobile Internet are more strongly perceived among female respondents than males.

AB  - Background: Sedentary behaviours (SB) are risk factors for poor cardiovascular health and all-cause mortality. However, their role in cognitive health in older adults is unclear. A few studies have examined associations between sedentary behaviours and cognition, but are limited by heterogeneity and insufficient longitudinal analyses. Therefore more robust studies, which would address identified limitations, are needed to accurately determine associations.
Method: This study analysed data collected from participants aged 50þ years of The Irish Longitudinal Study of Ageing (TILDA). We conducted cross-sectional linear regression with multivariate imputation analyses of baseline data from wave 1 (N ¼ 8163, weekday-sitting time), and wave 3 (N ¼ 6400, weekday-television viewing); longitudinal analyses between waves 1–3 (sitting) and waves 3–4 (television). Sedentary behaviours were analysed as both categorical and continuous variables. Outcome of cross-sectional analyses was standardised regression co-efficient of associations between sedentary exposures and cognitive function in respective waves, while for longitudinal analyses was cognitive change (verbal memory, verbal fluency, and global cognition) between waves based on standardised residuals.
Result: Study found significant but mild cross-sectional associations between 1-h increase in weekday-television viewing and poorer verbal memory (b ¼ 0.02, CI: 0.04, 0.003, P < 0.05) and verbal fluency (b ¼ 0.02, CI: 0.04, 0.002, P < 0.05). Baseline television viewing of 3.5þ h/day had mild but significant association with a decline in verbal fluency 2 years later in participants aged 65þ years, when compared with a reference category of <1.5 h of TV viewing (b ¼ 0.12, CI: 0.23, 0.001, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Our study findings indicated some association between increased levels of weekday-television viewing time, independent of physical activity, and poor cognition cross-sectionally and longitudinally in middle-aged and older adults. Intervention studies are needed to confirm the effects of SB on cognition in older adults. Public health campaigns should be targeted at displacing high levels of television viewing, in excess of 3.5 h/day among older adults.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity and exercise are fundamental components of a healthy lifestyle for youth living with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Yet few youth living with T1D achieve the daily minimum recommended levels of physical activity and some may spend much of their leisure time playing digital games. Objective: We examined characteristics of digital gaming versus non-digital gaming (Other exercise) sessions and whether youth with T1D who play digital games (Gamers) engaged in less Other exercise than youth who do not (Non-gamers) using data from the Type 1 Diabetes Exercise Initiative Pediatric (T1DEXIP) study. Methods: During a 10-day observation period, youth self-reported exercise sessions, digital gaming sessions, and insulin use. We also collected data from activity wearables, continuous glucose monitors, and insulin pump (if available). Results: The sample included 251 youth with T1D (age: 14±2 years old [mean±SD], self-reported HbA1c of 7.1±1.3%); 42% were female. Digital gaming sessions lasted longer, had less change in glucose, and lower mean heart rates during sessions than Other exercise sessions. Youth described a greater percent of digital gaming sessions (67%) as low intensity compared to Other exercise (30%) sessions. We had 31 youth who reported at least 1 digital gaming session (Gamers) and 220 youth who reported no digital gaming (Non-gamers). Notably, Gamers engaged in 86±43 minutes of Other exercise per day, which was comparable to the minutes of Other exercise per day reported by Non-gamers (80±47). Conclusions: Digital gaming sessions were longer in duration, had less change in glucose, and had lower mean heart rates compared to Other exercise sessions. Nevertheless, Gamers reported comparable levels of Other exercise per day as Non-gamers, suggesting digital gaming may not fully displace Other exercise in youth with T1D.

TI  - Digital Screen Time and Pediatric Sleep: Evidence from a Preregistered Cohort Study
AU  - Przybylski, Andrew K.
T2  - The Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - Objectives To determine the extent to which time spent with digital devices predicts meaningful variability in pediatric sleep. Study design Following a preregistered analysis plan, data from a sample of American children (n = 50 212) derived from the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health were analyzed. Models adjusted for child-, caregiver-, household-, and community-level covariates to estimate the potential effects of digital screen use.
Results Each hour devoted to digital screens was associated with 3-8 fewer minutes of nightly sleep and signiﬁcantly lower levels of sleep consistency. Furthermore, those children who complied with 2010 and 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics guidance on screen time limits reported between 20 and 26 more minutes, respectively, of nightly sleep. However, links between digital screen time and pediatric sleep outcomes were modest, accounting for less than 1.9% of observed variability in sleep outcomes.
Conclusions Digital screen time, on its own, has little practical effect on pediatric sleep. Contextual factors surrounding screen time exert a more pronounced inﬂuence on pediatric sleep compared to screen time itself. These ﬁndings provide an empirically robust template for those investigating the digital displacement hypothesis as well as informing policy-making. (J Pediatr 2019;205:218-23).

AB  - The academic debate on whether gameplay has a positive or negative effect on players’ psychosocial well-being has yet to cease. To resolve this debate, this study focuses on multiplayer social network games (MSNGs), the affordances of which may lead to the coexistence of augmentation and displacement effects. To unpack the conditions under which gameplay has a positive or negative relationship with psychological well-being, this study distinguishes between co-player interaction modes (in-game social interactions vs. social media interactions) and between co-players’ identity types (offline friends/acquaintances vs. guild members). An online survey was conducted with 300 gamers in China. The results revealed that more in-game interaction with co-players was positively associated with players’ loneliness, whereas more social media interaction with co-players was negatively related to players’ loneliness, regardless of the co-players’ identities. However, players who played with offline friends/acquaintances did engage in more social interactions than those who played with guild members, especially social media interactions. Moreover, the effect of playing with friends/acquaintances or guild members on players’ loneliness was fully mediated by in-game social interactions and social media interactions. That is, the psychosocial influence of gameplay heavily depends on the exact social interactions that players are involved in rather than on general time spent in games, and the augmentation and displacement effects possibly coincide within one game.

AU  - Reinecke, Leonard

T2  - Current Opinion in Psychology
AB  - The use of social media can have positive and negative effects on psychological well-being. The present article proposes that self-regulation and the related concept of self-control act as central boundary conditions of this relationship. Successfully self-regulated social media use can bolster psychological wellbeing through mood management and emotion-focused coping as well as through intrinsic need satisfaction. In contrast, poorly self-regulated forms of social media use can result in goal conflict, i.e., the displacement of, and distraction from other activities, which may negatively affect well-being. The article covers relevant factors that influence (un-)successful self-regulation of social media use, including media affordances, social dynamics, as well as trait and state user characteristics, including media habits and mindfulness.

AB  - Sedentary lifestyle patterns in children and adolescents, i.e. playing digital games, using computers and especially watching television, have been associated with obesity. However, not all sedentary behaviour has shown the same relevance to, and relationship with, obesity. Therefore, we conducted a review including published studies found in PubMed and other medical journals, dated between January 1990 and April 2007. The ages of the children and adolescents who were the object of the study ranged between 2 and 18 years. For the purpose of this paper, we selected cross-sectional, longitudinal and intervention studies. Sufﬁcient evidence exists to recommend setting a limit to the time spent watching TV, especially for younger children. However, video games and computers do not represent such a high risk compared to watching TV, when they do not replace physical activity too much. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that sedentary behaviour displaces physical activity levels. Mechanisms that explain the link between sedentariness and obesity are also discussed. Finally, future studies should take into account important mediators such as socioeconomic status and family structure.

AB  - Promoting regular physical activity (PA) is essential to population health, yet intervention success has been modest. Most approaches have focused heavily on PA motivation but give limited attention to other facilitating and conflicting goals in daily life. The purpose of this review was to unite the literature examining other life goals and appraise their relationship with PA. Ten electronic databases were searched from February to December 2015 through EBSCO with the keywords: goal, facilitation, conflict, interference, intergoal, time displacement, behavioral resolve, cross-behavior, PA and exercise. Combined with manual bibliography and citation searches, 292 potentially relevant abstracts were screened, 40 of which full-text articles were retrieved. A total of 20 articles with 22 independent data-sets met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present review. Despite relatively heterogeneous measurement and a large proportion of cross sectional designs with student samples, the results indicated that PA is related to other life goals both in terms of facilitation (positive association) and conflict (negative association). Both facilitation and conflict goals had more consistent significant associations with PA when they were measured in terms of behavioral (e.g., study behavior, TV viewing) rather than higher-level objectives (e.g., getting healthy, being social). These goals explained additional variance in PA beyond PA intentions, plans, and perceived behavioral control and helped translate positive intentions into behavior. The results suggest that PA interventions should consider PA motivation with the integration of other facilitating and conflicting goals in one's daily life; however, better measurement of goals, with more diverse samples in experimental designs are needed.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep problems related to technology affect college students through several potential mechanisms including displacement of sleep due to technology use, executive functioning abilities, and the impact of emotional states related to stress and anxiety about technology availability. Design: In the present study, cognitive and affective factors that inﬂuence technology usage were examined for their impact upon sleep problems. Participants and measurements: More than 700 US college students completed an online questionnaire addressing technology usage, anxiety/dependence, executive functioning, nighttime phone usage, bedtime phone location, and sleep problems.
Results: A path model controlling for background variables was tested using the data. The results showed that executive dysfunction directly predicted sleep problems as well as affected sleep problems through nighttime awakenings. In addition, anxiety/dependence increased daily smartphone usage and also increased nighttime awakenings, which, in turn, affected sleep problems.
Conclusions: Thus, both the affective and cognitive factors that inﬂuence technology usage affected sleep problems.

TI  - Incentivising ‘pirates’ to pay – An experiment with comic book readers
AU  - Rożynek, Satia

T2  - Information Economics and Policy
AB  - Internet piracy has been repeatedly shown to displace the authorised consumption of digital content. However, fewer studies tried to identify a viable solution and even less tried to convert the ‘pirates’ into paying consumers. We conducted a three-wave panel survey among comic book readers, asking about their consumption from various sources. After each wave, a random subsample was provided with prizes in the form of digital comic books from a legal provider. We analyse the effects of prizes on further consumption behaviour. The first prizing scheme incentivised setting up an account, installing a reader app and familiarising oneself with the catalogue of the dominant digital seller of comics. The second scheme aimed at hooking consumers on particular comic book series. However, we only find small evidence of a change in the consumption patterns or the willingness to pay for digital formats. We suggest that for the case of comic books, the prices of lower-valued digital copies might deter purchase. Furthermore, we discuss the use of similar research design for other creative content.

TI  - Explaining the success of social media with gratification niches: Motivations behind daytime, nighttime, and active use of TikTok in China
AU  - Scherr, Sebastian
AU  - Wang, Kexin
T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - Drawing from niche theory and the uses and gratifications approach, this study explores the gratification niches of TikTok as a new social media app. As a first step, we developed a catalogue of motives for using TikTok to assess users’ gratifications. As a second step, we explored the predictive value of these motives for TikTok’s competitive displacement potential among its users during the day and night and actively posting content. In a sample of N = 1051 TikTok users in China, parallel analysis revealed four distinct gratifications for TikTok use: socially rewarding self-presentation, trendiness, escapist addiction, and novelty. Age gender stratified analyses showed that novelty was the most relevant motives for using TikTok across all users. Age was positively correlated with trendiness and negatively correlated with escapist addiction. We could only observe one gender difference for addictive escapism being more relevant for women. Finally, TikTok’s potential for competitive displacement of other social media apps seemed to be “time-of-day-specific” with trendiness driving daytime use, novelty driving nighttime use, and posting TikTok videos being driven by socially rewarding self-presentations. Our findings therefore come with implications for theorizing on comparative social media uses and gratifications.

TI  - Nodding off but can't disconnect: development and validation of the iNOD index of Nighttime Offline Distress

AB  - Background: There is a pressing need to update sleep models, education and treatment to better reﬂect the realities of sleep in a 24/7 connected social world. Progress has been limited to date by available measurement tools, which have largely focused on the frequency or duration of individuals’ social media use, without capturing crucial sleep-relevant aspects of this inherently social and interactive experience.
Methods: Survey data from 3008 adolescents (aged 10e18 years) was used to rigorously develop and validate a new self-report measure that quantiﬁes difﬁculty disengaging from social media interactions at night: the index of Nighttime Ofﬂine Distress (iNOD). Exploratory and Conﬁrmatory Factor analyses in a random split sample produced a ten-item two-factor solution, with subscales capturing concerns about Staying Connected and Following Etiquette (Cronbach's alphas ¼ 0.91 and 0.92 respectively).
Results: Those with higher scores on these subscales tended to report using social media for longer after they felt they should be asleep (rs ¼ 0.41 and 0.26, respectively), shorter sleep duration (rs ¼ 0.24 and 0.17, respectively) and poorer sleep quality (rs ¼ 0.33 and 0.31, respectively). Results also pointed towards a potentially fragmented process of sleep displacement for those who may struggle to disconnect - and to stay disconnected - from social interactions in order to allow sufﬁcient uninterrupted sleep opportunity.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings can inform current models for understanding normal and disordered sleep during adolescence, whilst highlighting speciﬁc social concerns as important potential targets for sleep education efforts.

AB  - Background: Excessive time in front of a single or several screens could explain a displacement of physical activity. The present study aimed at determining whether screen-time is associated with a reduced level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in Spanish adolescents living in favorable environmental conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings: A multi-stage stratified random sampling method was used to select 3503 adolescents (12-18 years old) from the school population of Gran Canaria, Spain. MVPA, screen-time in front of television, computer, video game console and portable console was assessed in the classroom by fulfilling a standardized questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted by a set of social-environmental variables were carried out. Forty-six percent of girls (95% CI+/-2.3%) and 26% of boys (95% CI+/-2.1%) did not meet the MVPA recommendations for adolescents. Major gender differences were observed in the time devoted to vigorous PA, video games and the total time spent on screen-based activities. Boys who reported 4 hours*week-1 or more to total screen-time showed a 64% (OR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.44-0.86) increased risk of failing to achieve the recommended adolescent MVPA level. Participation in organized physical activities and sports competitions were more strongly associated with MVPA than screen-related behaviors. Conclusions/Significance: No single screen-related behavior explained the reduction of MVPA in adolescents. However, the total time accumulated through several screen-related behaviors was negatively associated with MVPA level in boys. This association could be due to lower availability of time for exercise as the time devoted to sedentary screen-time activities increases. Participation in organized physical activities seems to counteract the negative impact of excessive time in front of screens on physical activity. © 2011 Serrano-Sanchez, et al.

TI  - Exploring Pathways From Television Viewing to Academic Achievement in School Age Children
AU  - Shin, Nary
T2  - The Journal of Genetic Psychology
AB  - The author's purpose in this study was to test 4 hypotheses that proposed different paths for the influences of children's television viewing on their academic achievement. Data were drawn from the 1997 Child Development Supplement (CDS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The population for this study included 1,203 children between the ages of 6 and 13 years from the CDS-PSID data set. The author used structural equation modeling to test pathways from children's television viewing to their academic achievement. The author assumed that children's television viewing hindered their academic achievement by reducing certain traits that related to academic achievement. Results showed that 3 hypothetical models fit the data—the time-displacement hypothesis, the mental effort-passivity hypothesis, and the attention-arousal hypothesis. A 4th hypothetical model, the learning-information hypothesis, which proposed that children's television viewing practices stimulate their academic achievement, was not supported. In sum, children who watched more television tended to spend less time doing homework, studying, and reading for leisure. In addition, their behaviors became more impulsive, which resulted in an eventual decrease in their academic achievement.

AB  - Background: Sedentary or near-sedentary activities are associated with overweight/obesity in epidemiological studies. This has traditionally been attributed to physical activity displacement. A littleexplored area is whether behavioural stresses alter sensations of appetite and eating behaviour. We examined whether behaviours conducted seated (television viewing, video gaming) induce different eating patterns, associated with differential levels of stress response.
Methods and ﬁndings: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 72 overweight/obese adult males, assigned to three groups (24 per group): (i) non-violent television (control group); (ii) non-violent game (FIFA); (iii) violent game (Call of Duty). Following a standardized breakfast, the 1-h intervention was followed by 25-min rest, with sweet and savoury snacks and drinks available ad libitum. Stress markers (heart rate, blood pressure, visual analogue scale (VAS)) were measured throughout. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stress by VAS were signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) playing video games than watching non-violent television, though the two game groups did not differ. Considered separately, only the violent video game group consumed more energy (D ¼ 208.3 kcal, 95%CI 16, 400), sweet foods (D ¼ 25.9 g, 95%CI 9.9, 41.9) and saturated fat (D ¼ 4.36 g, 95%CI 0.76, 7.96) than controls.
Conclusion: Playing video games in overweight/obese adult males is associated with an acute stress response relative to watching non-violent television, associated with greater subsequent food intake. These ﬁndings highlight the need to focus on the metabolic effects, as well as the energy costs, of activities involving sitting in relation to obesity risk.

TI  - Displacement or complementarity? Assessing the relationship between social media and public library usage in the U.S., South Korea, and Singapore

T2  - Library & Information Science Research
AB  - The relevancy of public libraries is often called into question, with some saying that library services have been or will be displaced by, among other things, new media such as social media. This study tested this displacement hypothesis with survey data collected from three nations (the U.S.: N = 879; South Korea: N = 700; and Singapore: N = 987). Ordinal regressions were used to investigate the relationship between the use of social media and nine public library services, taking into account individual demographic diﬀerences. The results show that for all three nations, social media use has signiﬁcant complementary relationships with all nine library services examined. Computer and information literacy training showed the largest eﬀect size. However, signs of displacement eﬀects were observed in the odds ratio statistics, particularly among daily social media users and in reference services, library visits, and time spent in the library, suggesting that where displacement is concerned, these areas warrant extra attention.

AB  - A relationship between evening technology use and sleep has been established, and models suggest various mechanisms to explain this relationship. Recent updates to these models also suggest the inﬂuence of individual difference factors, such that the relationship between technology and sleep varies between young people. Flow is an experience of immersion and time distortion that could vary between adolescents when using technology. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ﬂow on the self-selected bedtimes of adolescents when videogaming. Seventeen older adolescent, experienced videogamers (age ¼ 15.9 ± 0.83 years), played a new videogame on two school-night evenings in a sleep laboratory. Game difﬁculty was set to “hard” one evening (ﬂow condition) and “easy” on the other evening (disrupted ﬂow). Trait and state ﬂow were measured, along with heart rate during videogaming, and bedtime measured objectively with real-time cameras. An interaction effect for heart rate indicated an elevated heart rate in the easy condition after 150 min of gaming (p < 0.02). No signiﬁcant differences were found in bedtimes between the easy and hard conditions (p ¼ 0.77). Adolescents high on trait ﬂow played for longer and selected signiﬁcantly later bedtimes than their low trait ﬂow peers but only for the hard (ﬂow) condition (12:22 AM vs. 10:53 PM, p ¼ 0.004). Similarly, adolescents with high state ﬂow went to bed signiﬁcantly later than those low on state ﬂow (12:24 PM vs. 10:52 PM, p ¼ 0.001), again only in the hard condition. These ﬁndings suggest that individual and situational characteristics may amplify the effects of technology use on the “sleep” of adolescents and provides support for the displacement of bedtime hypothesis.

TI  - Do Media Use and Physical Activity Compete in Adolescents? Results of the MoMo Study

AB  - Purpose The displacement hypothesis predicts that physical activity and media use compete in adolescents; however, findings are inconsistent. A more differentiated approach at determining the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use behaviors within subjects may be warranted. The aim of this study was to determine the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use by identifying clusters of adolescents with specific behavior patterns including physical activity in various settings (school, sports club, leisure time) and different types of media use (watching TV, playing console games, using PC / Internet). Methods Cross-sectional data of 2,083 adolescents (11–17 years) from all over Germany were collected between 2009 and 2012 in the Motorik-Modul Study. Physical activity and media use were self-reported. Cluster analyses (Ward’s method and K-means analysis) were used to identify behavior patterns of boys and girls separately. Results Eight clusters were identified for boys and seven for girls. The clusters demonstrated that a high proportion of boys (33%) as well as girls (42%) show low engagement in both physical activity and media use, irrespective of setting or type of media. Other adolescents are engaged in both behaviors, but either physical activity (35% of boys, 27% of girls) or media use (31% of boys and girls) predominates. These adolescents belong to different clusters, whereat in most clusters either one specific setting of physical activity or a specific combination of different types of media predominates. Conclusion The results of this study support to some extent the hypothesis that media use and physical activity compete: Very high media use occurred with low physical activity behavior, but very high activity levels co-occurred with considerable amounts of time using any media. There was no evidence that type of used media was related to physical activity levels, neither setting of physical activity was related to amount of media use in any pattern.

AB  - Social media has created a new social landscape for adolescents. Knowledge is needed on how this landscape shapes adolescents’ social skills and time spent with friends, as these outcomes are important to mental health and psychosocial functioning. Using five waves of biennially collected data from a birth cohort assessed throughout age 10–18 years (n = 812), we found that increased social media use predicted more time with friends offline but was unrelated to future changes in social skills. Age and sex did not moderate these associations but increased social media use predicted declined social skills among those high in social anxiety symptoms. The findings suggest that social media use may neither harm nor benefit the development of social skills and may promote, rather than displace, offline interaction with friends during adolescence. However, increased social media use may pose a risk for reduced social skills in socially anxious individuals.

AB  - Many children are reported to have insufficient physical activity (PA) placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes. Participating in sedentary activities such as playing electronic games is widely believed to contribute to less PA. However there is no experimental evidence that playing electronic games reduces PA. There is also no evidence regarding the effect of different types of electronic games (traditional sedentary electronic games versus new active input electronic games) on PA. Further, there is a poor understanding about how characteristics of children may moderate the impact of electronic game access on PA and about what leisure activities are displaced when children play electronic games. Given that many children play electronic games, a better understanding of the effect of electronic game use on PA is critical to inform child health policy and intervention.

T2  - Social Indicators Research
AB  - This paper discusses the results of a time budget survey which was conducted nationwide in Japan in 1995 on ‘information behavior’, that is, the amount of time people spent communicating and using information media ranging from conversations to computers. We propose a three-dimensional time budget survey as a method for measuring information behavior in actual life. The method classifies information behavior into 24 categories and measures them with respect to three factors, i.e. time, location and purpose of behavior. Our survey revealed that the total time spent on information behavior was about seven hours per day, of which about 45% was spent watching TV. The displacement effect of PC use on TV watching was estimated by a “time-shift matching” design. The results demonstrated that use of a PC does not significantly affect TV viewing, despite a large difference in TV viewing time between PC users and non-users.

TI  - “Video games for boys and chatting for girls?”: Gender, screen time activities and academic achievement in high school
AU  - Tak, Sangdong

T2  - Education and Information Technologies
AB  - Using national longitudinal data of students during their 9th and 11th grades, we address popular concerns over screen time activities distracting students’ academic pursuits. We examine gender differences in the types of screen time use, expecting the skill-based activity of video gaming to be more common among boys and the socially oriented activity of chatting online to be more common among girls. Following the displacement effect theory we hypothesize that screen time may displace educational activities, limiting time spent on math homework and lowering subsequent math test scores. Results confirm the gendered nature video gaming for boys, while the gendered nature of chatting online is less clear. Despite popular concerns, findings show no appreciable relationship of video gaming and online chatting with hours spent doing math homework. A very weak, negative association was detected between both screen activities and math test scores two years later, being strongest for the videogaming time of female students. Further research is needed on the full spectrum of screen time activities to determine any potential effects during this developmental stage.

AB  - Background: Displacement theory proposes that internet use can lead to heightened feelings of loneliness and depression, whereas the stimulation theory posits the opposite pathway. However, most investigations on this topic have been cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. Thus, we used cross-lagged network analyses to facilitate causal inferences in understanding the relations between Internet use, loneliness and depression.
Methods: The participants (N = 25,249) who were recruited from 22 colleges in Guangdong province, China completed the survey in 2020 and 2021. This study examined the interactions between Internet use, loneliness and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) among this participants. All analyses adjusted for demographics.
Results: Contemporaneous networks revealed strong connections within the depression cluster and negligible associations between loneliness and internet use. Key bridging nodes were loneliness, guilt, anhedonia, and concentration problems, which linked constructs across the network. Temporal analyses did not support either the displacement or stimulation hypotheses, showing that higher loneliness predicted future depressive symptoms such as sad mood and anhedonia, as well as marginally higher internet use. Internet use exhibited mixed effects, weakly reducing suicide risk while marginally exacerbating depressive symptoms over time.
Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of loneliness as a central driver and highlight the nuanced role of internet use.

AB  - Parenting in the digital age has been characterized as one of the most challenging tasks of the modern era. Parents are ambivalent about their mediating role. However, problematic aspects of adolescent online use have not been adequately addressed in education. The present study investigated parental perceptions of intervention needs within schools to prevent excessive/problematic use, enhance parent–child communication, and reduce family conflicts. Nine interviews with parents of adolescents residing in the UK were carried out and analyzed utilizing thematic analysis. Three main themes emerged as parental proposals: (i) schools as digital education providers and prevention hubs, (ii) provision of mental health literacy to raise awareness, resolve ambiguity regarding impacts and mitigate excessive use and impacts, and (iii) psychoeducation and upskilling. The third theme related to impacts from time spent on screens (time displacement), content-related impacts, and context-related impacts. The present study offers recommendations for media literacy during adolescence beyond e-safety (i.e., addressing interpersonal communication problems, privacy vs. disclosure issues), based on parents’ views, and provides new insights for media and emotional health literacy collaboration efforts. Future work should investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of such interventions to support the emotional health of young people and prevent problematic internet use escalation.

AU  - Thulin, Eva

AB  - From a joint temporal and socio-spatial perspective, we examine how young people’s everyday lives integrate with the use of digital media. Conceptually, we complement a standard displacement approach by advancing the role of time-space priorities, time elasticities, and online/offline intersections. We use micro-level data concerning youth aged 15–24 years from the Swedish Time-Use Survey, 2010–2011. Using covariate analysis, we compare heavy, medium, and light digital media users on weekdays and weekends. The results contradict expectations of a homogenous group of ‘digital natives’, also showing that heavy use is still gendered. Heavy users generally spend more time at home, perform more activities alone, and travel less. Heavy use is associated with less time spent on outdoor activity and sports, socializing offline, and watching TV, and more time sleeping at night. Digital media use is highly elastic to available free time on weekdays, but is very differently prioritized on weekends.

TI  - Evidence-based guidelines for the informal use of computers by children to promote the development of academic, cognitive and social skills
AU  - Tran, Phuoc

T2  - Ergonomics
AB  - The use of computers in the home has become very common among young children. This paper reviews research on the effects of informal computer use and identifies potential pathways through which computers may impact children's development. Based on the evidence reviewed, we present the following guidelines to arrange informal computer experiences that will promote the development of children's academic, cognitive and social skills: (1) children should be encouraged to use computers for moderate amounts of time (2–3 days a week for an hour or two per day) and (2) children's use of computers should (a) include non-violent action-based computer games as well as educational games, (b) not displace social activities but should instead be arranged to provide opportunities for social engagement with peers and family members and (c) involve content with pro-social and non-violent themes. We conclude the paper with questions that must be addressed in future research. Practitioner Summary: This paper reviews research on the effects of informal computer use on children's academic, cognitive and social skills. Based on the evidence presented, we have presented guidelines to enable parents, teachers and other adults to arrange informal computer experiences so as to maximise their potential benefit for children's development.

AB  - The younger generation is witnessing a major lifestyle change due to the incorporation of a myriad digital devices into their daily lives. Susceptibility to screen exposure at an early age may have far-reaching effects on health outcomes. A review of various cross-cultural studies would help to ascertain the impacts of screen-based technologies on adiposity among children and adolescents.

TI  - Videogames and guns in adolescents: T ests of a bipartite theory
AU  - Turel, Ofir
T2  - Computers in Human Behavior
AB  - The possible role of video gaming in imprinting aggressive and specifically gun-related behaviors has been elusive, and findings regarding these associations have been inconsistent. I address this gap by proposing and testing a bipartite theory that can explain inconsistent results regarding the previously assumed linear association between videogames and gun-related behaviors. The theory suggests that this association follows a U-shape. It posits that at low levels of video gaming time, video gaming displaces gun-related behaviors and shelters adolescents by keeping them occupied and by reducing opportunities and motivation to acquire guns. However, at some level of gaming time (because most popular games adolescents play include violent aspects), the assumed imprinting of aggressive behaviors overpowers the positive displacement force, and this can trivialize and naturalize gun-carrying behaviors, and ultimately increase motivation to obtain and carry guns. I tested this theory with two national samples of American adolescents (n1 ¼ 24,779 and n2 ¼ 26,543, out of which 403 and 378, respectively, reported bringing a gun to school in the last month). Multiple analyses supported the proposed U-shaped association. These findings show that the moral panic over video games is largely unsubstantiated, especially among light to moderate gamers.

TI  - Amount of Time Online Is Problematic if It Displaces Face-to-Face Social Interaction and Sleep

AB  - Reply by the current authors to the comments made by Claudia Marino (see record 2018-35250-001) on the original article. We thank Dr. Marino for her letter, with which we partially agree and partially disagree. First, we agree that other factors may also play a role in the rise in depression among adolescents after 2011. Indeed, as we have argued elsewhere (e.g., Twenge, 2017), the increase in digital-media use may be more of an indirect (rather than direct) cause of the increase in depression, in that it is the most likely explanation for the decline in face-to-face social interaction (Twenge & Campbell, 2018) and the decline in sleep time over this same time period (Twenge, Krizan, & Hisler, 2017). However, we view this not as a "complex interplay," as Marino described it, but as a relatively straightforward dislocation in which digital media displaces time once spent on face-to-face social interaction and sleep. How adolescents spend their leisure time has changed dramatically, which may have had significant impacts on their mental health. We disagree with Marino that "the amount of time spent online is not necessarily indicative of problematic use" (p. 455). The data in our article (Twenge, Joiner, Rogers, & Martin, 2018) show a fairly linear exposure-response curve; suicide-related outcomes steadily increase with daily hours of electronic device use.

AB  - We have documented increases since 2012 in depressive symptoms, suicide-related outcomes, and suicide and identified associations between digital-media use and depressive symptoms and suicide-related outcomes across two data sets: Monitoring the Future (MtF) and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Ophir, Lipshits-Braziler, and Rosenberg’s criticisms of the MtF data (this issue; pp. 374–378) are addressed by the YRBSS data, which included a measure of digital-media use in hours. Ophir et al. assumed that the displacement of nonscreen activities by screen activities occurs only at the individual level, whereas in fact, time displacement at the group or cohort level may be more important. Some discrepancies in the literature can be traced to the use of percentage variance explained; in fact, heavy (vs. light) digital-media users are considerably more likely (often twice as likely) to be depressed or low in well-being across several large data sets.

TI  - 4. Gaming Alone Together: The Role of Loneliness and Social Anxiety in Adolescent Video Gaming Behaviors

AB  - Purpose: Online social video games provide valuable socialization opportunities for adolescents, particularly those experiencing loneliness and social anxiety. However, the extent to which social gaming and in-game interactions contribute to difficulties in disengaging from gaming remains unclear. This study aims to 1) explore correlations between loneliness, social anxiety, and various gaming behaviors, including the frequency of solo and social play, play partner selection, and in-game interactions; and 2) examine their associations with symptoms of problematic gaming, characterized as excessive, uncontrollable gaming that can result in social and/or emotional problems. Method(s): We conducted a survey involving 1,468 U.S. adolescents aged 13-17 (M = 14.99, SD = 1.42), assessing loneliness, social anxiety, gaming behaviors such as the frequency of solo and social play, play partner selection (strangers vs. known figures), in-game real-time communication, and problematic gaming symptoms like preoccupation with gaming, conflicts with others over gaming time, and displacement of other activities (e.g., school, work, and sleep). Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted, followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate these relationships, incorporating demographics as covariates. Bootstrapping with 10,000 samples explored potential mediation roles of gaming behaviors. Result(s): The sample comprised 47.3% females, 46.7% males, and 3% non-binary individuals, with a diverse racial composition (41.3% White). CFA confirmed construct validity (CFI= .96, TLI= .95, RMSEA = .04, SRMR = .04). SEM indicated a good fit (CFI = .96, TLI = .91, RMSEA = .06, SRMR = .04) and explained significant variability in problematic gaming symptoms (46%) and various gaming behaviors (2.4% to 17.1%). Loneliness significantly predicted increased social play with both strangers (beta = .16, p < .001) and known figures (beta = .14, p < .001), and more in-game communication with strangers (beta= .31, p < .001) and known figures (beta =.12, p <.001). Social gaming with strangers (beta = .07, p < .001) and communicating with them (beta = .26, p < .001) were positively associated with problematic gaming symptoms. Notably, frequent real-time communication with strangers significantly intensified the relationship between gaming with them and problematic gaming symptoms (beta = .05, p < .05). Mediation analysis confirmed significant pathways from loneliness to problematic gaming through social play and in-game communication with strangers. Social anxiety correlated significantly only with solo play (beta = .17, p < .001). Boys reported higher engagement in social gaming (betastranger= -.24, p < .001; betaknown figure = -.17, p < .001), in-gaming communication (betastranger= -.27, p < .001; betaknown figure = -.10, p < .001), and more pronounced problematic gaming symptoms (beta = -.17, p < .001), compared to girls. Conclusion(s): Among adolescents who play video games, loneliness was associated with problematic gaming symptoms, mediated by social gaming and in-game communication with strangers. Online gaming may serve as a coping mechanism for adolescents with unsatisfactory in-person social relationships. With growing clinical awareness of problematic gaming, treatment strategies should move beyond reducing or eliminating gaming time to address underlying social struggles that may drive adolescents toward these behaviors.

TI  - Implications of a Natural Experiment in the Developed World for Research on Television in the Developing World
AU  - Williams, Tannis MacBeth
T2  - Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology
AB  - Three Canadian communities were studied, just before and two years after the inception of television reception in one of them. Some implications of the results of this natural experiment for research on television in the developing world are described in this article. The advantages of behavioral measures over ratings and potential bias in ratings due to sex role or other (e.g., racial) stereotypes are discussed, as are problems in conceptualizing and measuring TV use. The importance of studying television's effects due to displacement of other activities and the time-sharing of TV with other activities is outlined. The possibility that television affects the ways in which viewers process information, and the importance of this possibility for research in the developing world, is emphasized. Schema or script theory is put forth as a conceptual framework for studying television's content effects. The ways in which third variables such as intelligence and socioeconomic status may confound the relationship between TV use and other behavior also are discussed.

AB  - A current issue within the driver distraction community centres around diﬀerent ﬁndings regarding the impact of mobile phone conversation on driving found in driving simulators versus instrumented vehicles employed in real-world naturalistic driving studies (NDSs). This paper compares and contrasts the two types of studies and aims to provide reasons for the diﬀerences in ﬁndings that have been documented. A comprehensive review of literature and consultations with human factors experts highlighted that simulator studies tend to show degradation in driving performance, suggestive of increased crash risk as a result of mobile phone conversation. Whilst NDSs, at times, present data suggesting that mobile phone conversation distraction actually reduces crash risk. This study identiﬁes that these diﬀerences may be attributed to behavioural hypotheses associated with driver self-regulation, arousal from cognitive loading, task displacement and gaze concentration – all of which need to be explicitly tested in future driving studies.

TI  - Accessing the news in an age of mobile media: Tracing displacing and complementary effects of mobile news on newspapers and online news
AU  - Westlund, Oscar

T2  - Mobile Media & Communication
AB  - Legacy news media have invested substantially in developing digital and mobile news provisioning, alongside the widespread diffusion of information and communication technologies. Amid these developments, many people have shifted the ways they access the news in everyday life, with mobile devices gaining much significance. This has shifted the roles traditionally played by newspapers, television stations, radio broadcasters and news sites, ultimately relating to their democratic functions and the diminishing effect of their business models. This article will describe and explain displacing vis-à-vis complementary effects among age cohorts. It shows how the recent uptake of mobile devices has influenced news consumption via newspapers and news sites. It investigates three research questions, each focusing age cohorts in relation to single-media use, cross-media use, and nonuse. The article presents a statistical analysis of datasets nationally representative to Sweden and the specific case of evening tabloids. The data used originate from scientific omnibus survey projects conducted annually from 1986 to 2012 at the University of Gothenburg. The findings show that the public generally engage in single-media rather than cross-media news consumption, whereas age cohorts have developed divergent forms of single-media use: (a) the 1930s and 1940s age cohort are primarily single-media users in print, (b) the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s age cohorts are computer-oriented single-media users; and (c) the 1980s and 1990s age cohorts are mainly single-media users via mobile devices, but also cross-media users of mobile devices combined with a computer. As of 2012, the uptake of mobile news and cross-media news consumption reached new records, whereas the single-media use of printed newspapers reached a new low. The integrated theoretical framework proves useful for comprehending such transforming news consumption among age cohorts, and reveals the significance for legacy news media to explore and exploit the opportunities arising from mobile devices and tablets.

T2  - Technology, Mind, and Behavior
AB  - Internet technologies’ and platforms’ potential psychological consequences remain debated. While these technologies have spurred new forms of commerce, education, and leisure, many are worried that they might negatively affect individuals by, for example, displacing time spent on other healthy activities. Relevant findings to date have been inconclusive and of limited geographic and demographic scope. We examined whether having (mobile) internet access or actively using the internet predicted eight well-being outcomes from 2006 to 2021 among 2,414,294 individuals across 168 countries. We first queried the extent to which well-being varied as a function of internet connectivity. Then, we examined these associations’ robustness in a multiverse of 33,792 analysis specifications. Of these, 84.9% resulted in positive and statistically significant associations between internet connectivity and well-being. These results indicate that internet access and use predict well-being positively and independently from a set of plausible alternatives.

AB  - There is a public concern that smartphone communication undermines well-being by displacing face-to-face interactions. However, research on this “social displacement hypothesis” has provided mixed results. We examined when this hypothesis holds true (within-persons vs. between-persons) and tested an intervention to decrease smartphone communication. Participants (N = 109) reported daily on smartphone communication, face-to-face communication, and emotional well-being for fifteen days. At day six, participants were assigned to a mindfulness-treatment intervention group or a no-treatment control group. The social displacement hypothesis was confirmed at the within-person but not between-person level. Specifically, when someone communicates a lot using her smartphone during a particular day, that person engages in less face-to-face interactions during that same day. However, people who tend to spend a lot of time communicating on their smartphone do not engage in less face-to-face conversations than people who largely refrain from smartphone communication. The mindfulness-intervention reduced daily smartphone communication, which decreased negative emotions.

AB  - The role of daily time spent sedentary and in different intensities of physical activity (PA) for the maintenance of muscle health currently remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the impact of reallocating time spent in different PA intensities on sarcopenia risk in older adults, while considering PA type (muscle strengthening activities, MSA) and protein intake. In a sample of 235 community-dwelling older adults (65–70 years), a sarcopenia risk score (SRS) was created based on muscle mass assessed by bioimpedance, together with handgrip strength and performance on the five times sit-to-stand (5-STS) test assessed by standardized procedures. Time spent in light-intensity PA (LPA), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and being sedentary was assessed by accelerometry, and PA type (MSA) by self-report. Linear regression models based on isotemporal substitution were employed. Reallocating sedentary time to at least LPA was significantly (p < 0.05) related to a lower SRS, which remained evident after adjustment by PA type (MSA) and protein intake. Similarly, reallocating time in LPA by MVPA was related to a significantly (p < 0.05) lower SRS. Our results emphasize the importance of displacing sedentary behaviours for more active pursuits, where PA of even light intensities may alleviate age-related deteriorations of muscle health in older adults.

AB  - Social media holds promise as a technology to facilitate social engagement, but may displace offline social activities. Adolescents with ASD are well suited to capitalize on the unique features of social media, which requires less decoding of complex social information. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in 44 adolescents with ASD, and 56 clinical comparison controls. Social media use was significantly associated with high friendship quality in adolescents with ASD, which was moderated by the adolescents’ anxiety levels. No associations were founds between social media use, anxiety and friendship quality in the controls. Social media may be a way for adolescents with ASD without significant anxiety to improve the quality of their friendships.

T2  - Infant Behavior and Development
AB  - There has been little research on whether and how screen media usage affects social-emotional (SE) function prior to two years of age, even though early SE development is understood to be nurtured through interpersonal experience, mainly withthe primary caregiver. This study sought to characterise infant screen media usage and understand how it may link with concurrent SE function by testing associated effects on reducing parent-infant interaction and of parent psychological factors. Questionnaire responses from 327 UK-based parents of infants aged 6–24 months showed diverse usage in the amount of time spent on screen media (‘screen time’) and amount of parental involvement (co-sharing and co-referencing). Infants with possible SE delay experienced more screen time than those at low risk. The study tested three mediation models and found support for the displacement and not distancing hypothesis based on this community sample. While screen time predicted both SE competence and SE problems, reduced parent-infant play partially mediated the effect on SE competence. Parent depressed mood was positively linked with infant SE problems, but there was little evidence that increased screen time mediated this effect. Also, parent reflective function and attitudes toward parent-infant play were unrelated to screen time. Though longitudinal study is warranted, the findings implicate screen media usage as potentially directly and indirectly relevant when addressing infant mental health.

AU  - Van Der Voort, Tom H.A

T2  - Developmental Review
AB  - This article reviews the available research literature on television's influence on fantasy play. Whether television viewing influences children's fantasy play positively (stimulation hypothesis) or negatively (reduction hypothesis) is examined. There is evidence that television viewing absorbs time that children would otherwise spend in play (displacement). Apart from displacement effects, television's influence on fantasy play depends on the types of programs a child watches. In exceptional cases, educational programs can enhance fantasy play. Benign, nonviolent programs do not affect fantasy play, whereas programs with high levels of violence reduce fantasy play. The authors discuss the empirical support for several different stimulation and reduction hypotheses. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The IOM's L.E.A.D. framework (Locate, Evaluate, and Assemble evidence to inform Decisions) guided a comprehensive analysis of research examining links between TV (amount, content) and child health outcomes, which resulted in the development of a novel conceptual model expressing these links and strengths of relationships. Terms searched in CINAHL, PubMed, and PsychInfo databases (children, food marketing, BMI, television, media) yielded 39 articles. Research suggests links between TV usage and physical health (BMI, eating disorders, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, asthma, sleep disorders), psychological health (depression, mood disorders), behavior (violence, aggression, substance abuse), and learning. TV's contribution to BMI include calorie conservation via displacement of energy expending activities and increased energy intake by promoting more eating occasions featuring calorie-dense foods. Interventions aiming to reduce TV viewing and children's BMI have mixed results indicating a need to help parents understand TV's role in children's health and the importance of establishing household policies regulating TV viewing time. This study's conceptual model can be used by health promotion and nutrition communication professionals to visually convey to parents the health consequences of TV viewing to increase their understanding of how TV affects child health.

AB  - Purpose 
          This study examined the prospective associations of reallocating time spent in different types of sedentary behavior, physical activity, and sleep with body mass index (BMI) in children using isotemporal substitution analysis.
          Methods 
          Chinese children in grades 1–3 were recruited to a cohort study in 2009 and were followed up over a 2-yr period. Reports were gathered from the parents on children’s sedentary behavior, sleep duration, and sociodemographic variables. The reported sedentary behavior types were then grouped into three categories: screen time (e.g., watching TV), academic-related activities (e.g., doing homework), and other sedentary behaviors (e.g., sitting and talking). Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and light-intensity physical activity were assessed by ActiGraph accelerometry (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL). Isotemporal substitution models were performed to examine the effects of time allocation on BMI.
          Results 
          A total of 672 children (359 boys, mean age at recruitment = 7.6 yr) who had provided valid accelerometer data for at least one assessment time point were included in the analysis. Controlling for covariates and total behavior time, isotemporal substitution models indicated that the displacement of 30 min·d−1 of other sedentary behaviors with equal amounts of screen time (B = 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.20) or academic-related activities (B = 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.21) was associated with higher BMI. Reallocating 30 min·d−1 of MVPA with each of the sedentary behavior variables resulted in increased BMI.
          Conclusions 
          The substitution of screen time or academic-related activities with other sedentary behaviors or MVPA was associated with lower BMI in Chinese children.

AB  - Sedentary behaviour, sleeping, and physical activity are thought to be independently associated with health outcomes but it is unclear whether these associations are due to the direct physiological effects of each behaviour or because, across a finite 24-hour day, engagement in one behavior requires displacement of another. The aim of this study was to examine the replacement effects of sedentary behaviour (total sitting, television/computer screen time combined), sleeping, standing, walking, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on all-cause mortality using isotemporal substitution modelling.

AB  - For a fixed amount of time engaged in physical activity, activity choice may affect body weight differently depending partly on other activities’ displacement. Typical models used to evaluate effects of physical activity on body weight do not directly address these substitutions. An isotemporal substitution paradigm was developed as a new analytic model to study the time-substitution effects of one activity for another. In 1991–1997, the authors longitudinally examined the associations of discretionary physical activities, with varying activity displacements, with 6-year weight loss maintenance among 4,558 healthy, premenopausal US women who had previously lost &gt;5% of their weight. Results of isotemporal substitution models indicated widely heterogeneous relations with each physical activity type (P &lt; 0.001) depending on the displaced activities. Notably, whereas 30 minutes/day of brisk walking substituted for 30 minutes/day of jogging/running was associated with weight increase (1.57 kg, 95% confidence interval: 0.33, 2.82), brisk walking was associated with lower weight when substituted for slow walking (−1.14 kg, 95% confidence interval: −1.75, −0.53) and with even lower weight when substituted for TV watching. Similar heterogeneous relations with weight change were found for each activity type (TV watching, slow walking, brisk walking, jogging/running) when displaced by other activities across these various models. The isotemporal substitution paradigm may offer new insights for future public health recommendations.

AB  - Objective
Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep are associated with mental health in adolescents. Mental health may depend not only on the amount of time spent in a specific activity, but also on the activity it displaces. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of reallocating 15 min of time spent in one health behavior with 15 min in another on adolescent mental health.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from the students participating in the COMPASS Study (2018–2019) were analyzed (N = 46,413). Participants self-reported the amount of time they spent engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), doing homework and using screens, and their sleep duration on average each day, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and flourishing. Data were analyzed using isotemporal substitution modeling.
Results
Among adolescents getting less than the recommended amount of sleep, replacing any behavior with sleep was generally associated with better mental health outcomes. Conversely, among adolescents getting adequate sleep, the findings did not support replacing other behaviors with sleep with the exception of screen time. Replacing homework and MVPA with sleep was associated with less flourishing regardless of sleep duration.
Conclusions
Replacing screen time with any behavior may be better for mental health outcomes. Results provide further support for the critical role of sleep in promoting healthy development during adolescence, though more sleep than is recommended may confer little benefit for mental health. The findings demonstrate that mental health benefits may be obtainable at intervals as short as 15 min.

AB  - The advent of Internet-enabled mobile digital devices has transformed U.S. adolescent technology use over the last decade, yet little is known about how these changes map onto other health-related behaviors. We provide a national profile of how contemporary technology use fits into adolescents’ daily health lifestyles compared with the previous generation, with particular attention to whether and for whom technology use displaces time spent in sleep or physical activity. Time diaries were collected from 11- to 17-year-olds in 2002-2003 (N = 1,139) and 2014-2016 (N = 527) through the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement. Contemporary adolescents spent 40 minutes more per week in technology-focused activities, but their composition was more varied compared with the earlier cohort. Contemporary technology use was predictive of less time in physical activity, and adolescents who engaged in frequent video game play spent less time in physical activity compared with peers with other technology use profiles.

AB  - Increases in screen time have been found to be associated with increases in depressive symptoms. However, longitudinal studies are lacking.To repeatedly measure the association between screen time and depression to test 3 explanatory hypotheses: displacement, upward social comparison, and reinforcing spirals.This secondary analysis used data from a randomized clinical trial assessing the 4-year efficacy of a personality-targeted drug and alcohol prevention intervention. This study assessed screen time and depression throughout 4 years, using an annual survey in a sample of adolescents who entered the seventh grade in 31 schools in the Greater Montreal area. Data were collected from September 2012 to September 2018. Analysis began and ended in December 2018.Independent variables were social media, television, video gaming, and computer use. Symptoms of depression was the outcome, measured using the Brief Symptoms Inventory. Exercise and self-esteem were assessed to test displacement and upward social comparison hypothesis.A total of 3826 adolescents (1798 girls [47%]; mean [SD] age, 12.7 [0.5] years) were included. In general, depression symptoms increased yearly (year 1 mean [SD], 4.29 [5.10] points; year 4 mean [SD], 5.45 [5.93] points). Multilevel models, which included random intercepts at the school and individual level estimated between-person and within-person associations between screen time and depression. Significant between-person associations showed that for every increased hour spent using social media, adolescents showed a 0.64-unit increase in depressive symptoms (95% CI, 0.32-0.51). Similar between-level associations were reported for computer use (0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91). Significant within-person associations revealed that a further 1-hour increase in social media use in a given year was associated with a further 0.41-unit increase in depressive symptoms in that same year. A similar within-person association was found for television (0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27). Significant between-person and within-person associations between screen time and exercise and self-esteem supported upward social comparison and not displacement hypothesis. Furthermore, a significant interaction between the between-person and within-person associations concerning social media and self-esteem supported reinforcing spirals hypothesis.Time-varying associations between social media, television, and depression were found, which appeared to be more explained by upward social comparison and reinforcing spirals hypotheses than by the displacement hypothesis. Both screen time modes should be taken into account when developing preventive measures and when advising parents.

T2  - Journal of Children and Media
AB  - The debate about the impact of digital media use on youths’ well-being is polarized. We provide a comprehensive examination of the relationship between digital media use and adolescents’ affective well-being, investigating both within-person and between-person associations. We also examined how age and gender moderate these relationships, considering developmental stages. Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), we collected 3,087 responses from 343 Austrian students between September and November 2022, covering social media use, gaming, web browsing, video streaming, and audio streaming. Multilevel linear regression analyses revealed nuanced associations: Within-person associations appeared positive for social media use, gaming, and video streaming, whereas social media use was negatively related to affective well-being at the between-person level, suggesting aggregated displacement effects. The positive association of gaming with affective well-being was confined to the within-person level, yet video streaming showed a consistently positive link at both levels. The complex associations further varied by age and gender, indicating developmental variability. This study highlights the importance of considering development in media use and effects research and calls attention to how short-term influences may interplay with individual traits, fostering long-term differences. Research has largely focused on the effects of social media and gaming through cross-sectional studies. Comprehensive analyses of various digital media activities across developmental stages using in-situ methodologies are limited. This study examines multiple digital media activities, analyzes within- and between-person associations, and integrates developmental perspectives. It highlights the variability in adolescents’ responses, advancing the understanding of how media use impacts well-being across developmental stages. Findings provide insights for parents, educators, and healthcare providers by integrating developmental factors. We predict how short-term patterns of digital media use may influence long-term well-being, enabling developmentally appropriate interventions for adolescents.

AB  - Introduction. The Internet and social media have revolutionized access to information on health and parenting issues. Virtual consultations are spreading worldwide, are increasing, and represent a challenge for professional practice. Objective. To characterize the use of the Internet and social media by mothers and fathers as a source of information on the health and parenting of their children. Population and methods. A descriptive, cross-sectional study in an outpatient pediatric center in the City of Buenos Aires to determine the online consultation habits of caregivers of healthy children or children with health problems. Results. Two hundred-one surveys were analyzed, and the answers were predominantly from mothers of healthy children; 70.6% search online for health and parenting topics; 80% consult more than once a month. Although 36% of the families use the information to complement the medical consultation, 95% would not replace the pediatric consultation with the online search. The participants are not in the habit of following official pages, nor do they tend to verify the veracity of the contents. The search topics are related to the child's age, and satisfaction with the information results are modified according to whether the child is healthy or has a health problem. Only 4.7% responded that the search always answers their questions. Conclusions. Caregivers frequently seek online parenting and health information, but the sources are not always reliable. Although consultation with pediatricians is not displaced, we need to know the impact of online information on health decision-making. Pediatricians can intervene and guide caregivers to safe sources.Copyright © 2025 Sociedad Argentina de Pediatria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Young children are frequently engaged or soothed by mobile devices, although it is unknown whether this practice affects a child's development. To investigate the long-term, reciprocal relationships between young children's executive functioning (EF) and emotional reactivity and the frequency that parents report utilizing mobile devices to soothe them. Material(s) and Method(s): A convenience sample of parents typically developing children between the ages of 3 and 6 was used in this prospective study. The research was conducted between August 2021 and January 2023. Mobile gadgets are frequently used, according to parents, to soothe distressed kids (3-point Likert scale). The Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Reactivity subscale was used to measure the child's emotional reactivity at each wave, and the Behavior Rating Inventory (BRI) of Executive Function-Preschool Version Global Executive Composite was used to measure the child's EF. In order to investigate the cross-lagged relationships between the usage of calming aids, EF, and emotional reactivity, structural equation models were created (Child Behavior Questionnaire-Very Short Form surgency score, median split). Result(s): Among 500 eligible children the crude OR for executive functioning to non-regular users was 1.85 (95% CI [1.25+/-2.74], p = .002) for regular users (Crude model in Table 5). The IPTW-OR for executive functioning was 1.82 (95% CI [1.15+/-2.87], p = .009) for regular users. Among the boys, the use of devices to calm was associated with higher emotional reactivity (r [standardized regression coefficient] = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.10-0.30), while higher emotional reactivity had a non-significant association with increased device use for calming. Among children with high temperamental surgency, the use of devices to calm was associated with increased emotional reactivity while higher emotional reactivity was associated with increased device use for calming. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study suggest that the frequent use of mobile devices for calming young children may displace their opportunities for learning emotion-regulation strategies over time; therefore, pediatric health care professionals may wish to encourage alternate calming approaches.Copyright © International Journal of Academic Medicine and Pharmacy 2023.

AB  - Obesity has become a worldwide public health problem. Considerable research has shown that the media contribute to the development of child and adolescent obesity, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Screen time may displace more active pursuits, advertising of junk food and fast food increases children's requests for those particular foods and products, snacking increases while watching TV or movies, and late-night screen time may interfere with getting adequate amounts of sleep, which is a known risk factor for obesity. Sufficient evidence exists to warrant a ban on junk-food or fast-food advertising in children's TV programming. Pediatricians need to ask 2 questions about media use at every well-child or well-adolescent visit: (1) How much screen time is being spent per day? and (2) Is there a TV set or Internet connection in the child's bedroom?
